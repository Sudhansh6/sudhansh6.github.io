The last argument is to show that, given a supermartingale $$\tilde Z$$ with $$\tilde Z_t \geq Y_t$$ for all $$t$$, then $$\tilde Z_t = Z_t$$ for all $$t$$. This proves uniqueness.

We have

$$
\begin{align*}
\tilde Z_{t - 1} &= \max(Y_{t - 1}, \mathbb E(\tilde Z \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1})) \\
&\leq \max(Y_{t - 1}, \mathbb E(Z_t \vert \mathcal F_{t -1})) \\
&\leq \max(Y_{t - 1}, Z_{t - 1}) = Z_{t - 1}
\end{align*}
$$

We have already shown that $$(Z_t)_{t - 0}^T$$ is the least supermartingale majorant of $$(Y_t)_{t = 0}^T$$. This proves uniqueness.

### Pricing an American Call

Can we find a $$\phi^*$$ such that $$V_t(\phi^*) \geq U_t$$. We had derived the following before

$$
\begin{align*}
\tilde \alpha_t = \frac{U^u_t - U^d_t}{u - d} \frac{1}{S_{t - 1}} \\
\tilde \beta_t = \frac{uU^d_t - dU^u_t}{u - d} \frac{1}{B_{t - 1}} 
\end{align*}
$$

An important to thing to note here is that these values are random variables and are measurable under $$\mathcal F_{t - 1}$$. However, this strategy will not be self-financed due to the super-martingale property. The value of the portfolio is

$$
\tilde \alpha_t S_t + \tilde \beta_t B_t \equiv U_t
$$

Then we have,

$$
\begin{align*}
    U_{t - 1} &= Y_{t - 1} \vee \left(\frac{1}{1 + r} \mathbb E^*(U_t \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1})\right)\\
\tilde \delta_t &:= U_{t - 1} - \frac{1}{1 + r} \mathbb E^*(U_t \vert \mathcal F_{T - 1}) \geq 0 \\
&\because \tilde \delta_t \geq 0 \Leftrightarrow Y_{t - 1} > \frac{1}{1 + r} \mathbb E^*(U_T \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1}) 
\end{align*}
$$

Now, consider the following strategy

$$
\begin{align*}
\alpha^*_t &= \tilde \alpha_t \\
\beta_t^* &= \tilde \beta_t + \sum_{s = 1}^t \tilde \delta_s/B_{s - 1} \geq \tilde \beta_t
\end{align*}
$$

This trading strategy $$\phi^* = \{(\alpha^*, \beta^*): t = 1, \dots, T\}$$ is a **super-hedging strategy** with $$V_t(\phi^*) \geq U_t$$. We introduced $$\tilde \delta_t$$ to make it a self-financing strategy.

Define $$\bar \tau = \bar \tau(0) = \min(T: U_t = Y_T) \wedge T$$. Then, $$U_{t - 1} > Y_{t - 1}$$  and $$\tilde \delta_t = 0$$ for $$t = 1, \dots, \bar \tau(w)$$.  Consequently, $$V_{t \wedge \tau}(\phi^*) = U_{t \wedge \tau}$$, and $$U^*_{t \wedge \tau} = \frac{U_{t \wedge \tau}}{(1 + r)^{t \wedge \tau}}$$ forming a martingale.

### Arbitrage

For a trading strategy $$\psi$$, we have $$V_0(\psi) = 0$$ and $$V_T(\psi) \geq 0$$. Alternately, $$P(V_T(\psi) > 0) > 0$$. In an American option, there is an asymmetry between the buyers and the sellers. The buyer has to choose only one time $$t \leq T$$ to exit the option whereas the seller has to safeguard against an arbitrage in all possibilities.

The **seller's arbitrage** for a strategy $$\phi^s$$ (in stocks and bonds) is then defined as

$$
\begin{align*}
    V_0(\phi^s) &= C_0 \\
    \forall \tau V_\tau(\phi^s) &\geq Y_\tau \\
&> \quad \quad \text{sometimes}
\end{align*}
$$

The seller sells an option for $$C_0$$ and makes an investment of $$C_0$$ in $$\phi_s$$. Then an arbitrage for the seller is

$$
V_T = (V_\tau(\phi^s) - Y_\tau)(1 + r)^{T - \tau}
$$

where $$\tau$$ is the time when the buyer exits the option. This value is always greater than or equal to $$0$$ with a non-zero probability that it is strictly greater than $$0$$. 

On the other hand, the **buyer's arbitrage** for a strategy $$\phi_b$$ is defined as

$$
\begin{align*}
V_0(\phi^b) &= -C_0 \\
\exists \tau V_\tau(\phi^b) + Y_\tau &\geq 0 \\
&> \quad \quad \text{sometimes}
\end{align*}
$$

The arbitrage at time $$T$$ is $$(V_\tau(\phi^b) + Y_\tau)(1 + r)^{T - \tau}$$.

What would be the good time to exercise the option? In the following sections, we'll see that $$\tau = \bar \tau$$ is the optimal time to exit the option.

### Example

Consider a put option $$Y_T = (K - S_t)^+$$ where $$K = 150, S_0 = 100, u = 2, d = 0.5, r = 0.2, T = 2$$. We get $$U_0 = 53.09$$ and $$Y_0 = 50$$. Then, the super-hedging strategy is given by

$$
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}
$$
