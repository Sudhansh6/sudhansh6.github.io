We will cover one last concept in SQL and then move on to ER models.

## OLAP

OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing. It allows interactive analysis of data, allowing data to be summarized and viewed in different ways in an online fashion. Data that can be modeled as dimension attributes and measure attributes are called **multidimensional data**. 

**Measure attributes** measure some value that can be aggregated upon. **Dimension attributes** define the dimension on which measure attributes are viewed.
