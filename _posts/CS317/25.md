Sparse indices take less space and have less maintenance overhead in comparison to dense indices. However, they are generally slower than dense indices. 

**Note.** Secondary indices have to be dense. 

We use **lexicographic ordering** for composite search keys. 

## B$$^+$$-Tree

We will ignore duplicate keys for now. The number of children for every node lies within a certain specified range for that tree. In a $$B^+$$-Tree we have $$n$$ pointers and $$n-1$$ values separating them. A pointer between values $$a$$ and $$b$$ will point to values $$c$$ that satisfy $$a \leq c < b$$. It is not necessary for the internal nodes to be full.

Formally, a $$B^+$$-tree is a rotted tree satisfying the following properties

- All paths from the root to a leaf are of the same length.
- Each node that is not a root or a leaf has between $$\lceil{n/2}\rceil$$ and $$n$$ children.
- A lead node has between $$\lceil (n - 1)/2 \rceil$$ and $$n - 1$$ values. 
- If a root is not a leaf, it has at least 2 children, and if a root is a lead, it can have between $$0$$ and $$n - 1$$ values.

A typical node looks like $$P_! \mid K_1 \mid \dots \mid K_{n - 1} \mid P_n$$. Here $$K_i$$ are the search-key values and $$P_i$$ are pointers to children or records (buckets of records). Also, $$K_1 < \dots < K_{n - 1}$$.

### Leaf nodes

For $$i = 1, \dots, n - 1$$, pointer $$P_i$$ points to a file record with search-key value $$K_i$$.

Pointers help us keep the nodes logically close but they need not be physically close. The non-lead levels of the $$B^+$$ tree form a hierarchy of sparse indices. The level below root has at least $$2* \lceil n/2 \rceil$$ values, the next level has $$2* \lceil n/2 \rceil* \lceil n/2 \rceil$$, and so on. So if there are $$K$$ search key values in the file, the tree height is no more than $$\lceil \log_{\lceil n/1 \rceil} K\rceil$$.

### Queries on $$B^+$$-trees

**Range queries** finds all records with search key values in a given range. These are implemented as iterators. 

To handle non-unique keys, create a composite key that indexes into the duplicate values. Search for an index can be implemented as a range query. If the index is clustering, then all accesses are sequential. However, if the index if non-clustering, each record access may need an I/O operation.

### Insertion on $$B^+$$-trees

Insertion is easy when the nodes are not full. However, when nodes are full, we would have to split the nodes. We split a node through the parent, by adding a splitting value in the parent node. We do this recursively, and if the root gets full, we create a new root. We insert from leaves because the leaves hold the pointers to records.

The above image gives the formal algorithm.

### Deletion on $$B^+$$-trees

We need to ensure that there are at least a minimum number of values in each node. The complexity of the updates is of the order $$\mathcal O( \log_{\lceil n/2 \rceil}K)$$. The height of the tree decreases when a node has very few children. Note that a deleted value can still appear as a separator in the tree after the deletion. Also, the average node occupancy depends on the insertion order (2/3rds with random and 1/2 with insertion in sorted order).
