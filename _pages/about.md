Hello! I'm Sudhansh, a first-year Masters in Computer Science student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). I am a graduate of [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering with honors and pursued a minor in Entrepreneurship.
  
I have worked with [Prof. Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/) on the Likelihood Maximization method for Saturation Compressed Sensing. We are also working on developing algorithms for correction of Permutation Noise in Compressed Sensing. 
We have submitted a journal paper to Elsevier Signal Processing 2023 based on this work. 
In addition to this, I have worked with [Prof. Marta Betcke](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/M.Betcke.html) on Stochastic Primal Dual algorithms for Tomographic Reconstruction of 3D volumes in Low-Dose conditions, and we have a journal paper in preparation.
