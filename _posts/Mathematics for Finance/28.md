Consider another example where $$X = g(\max_{0 \leq t \leq T} S_t)$$ , then the no-arbitrage price is

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb E[X \vert \mathcal F_t] &= Y_t = f(\underbrace{Z_t}_{\text{Ito}}, \underbrace{A_t}_{\text{adapted and r.c.}}, t)\\
&\implies dY_T = f_1' dZ_t + f_2' dA_t + f_3' dt + f''d \langle Z\rangle -- (1)
\end{align*}
$$

where $$A_t = \max_{0 \leq u \leq t} S_u$$ (the Lebesgue measure of this set is 0).

$$
\begin{align*}
A_T &= A_t \vee S_t \left(\max_{u \leq u \leq T} \frac{S_u}{S_t}\right) \\
&= A_t \vee S_t \max_{0 \leq v \leq T- t}\exp(\underbrace{\sigma W_{t + v} - \sigma W_t}_{\sigma \hat W_v} - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}(v))\\
&= A_t \vee S_t \underbrace{\hat A_{T - t}}_{\perp \!\!\! \perp \mathcal F_t} 
\end{align*}
$$

So, we get $$V_t = \psi(S_t, A_t, t) = \mathbb E[A_t \vee (S_t \hat A_{T - t})]$$ (note that $$\mathcal F_t$$ goes away).

Using Ito's formula (equation (1) above) ,

$$
\begin{align*}
dV_t = \underbrace{\psi_1' dS_t}_{\text{martingale}} + \psi_2' dA_t + \psi_3' dt + \psi'' \sigma^2 S^2 dt
\end{align*}
$$

$$dV_t$$ should be a martingale by definition, therefore, $$\psi_2' dA_t + \psi_3' dt + \psi'' \sigma^2 S^2 dt = 0$$. Since $$dA_t$$ and $$dt$$ are independent

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \psi }{\partial A_t} = 0 \text{ when } dA_t = 0 &\implies S_t = A_t \implies \{(S_t, A_t, t): S_t \leq A_t ,0\leq t\leq T\} \\
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 x^2 \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2}  = 0&, x<y
 \end{align*}
$$

Generally, such PDEs are solved by curated guesses, and there is no algorithmic procedure to determine these.
