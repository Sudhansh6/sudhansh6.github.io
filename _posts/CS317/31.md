### Cache conscious algorithms

The goal is to minimise the cache misses. 

- **Sorting** - We can use runs that are as large as L3 cache to avoid cache misses during sorting of a run. Then merge runs as usual in merge sort.
- **Hash-join** - We first create partitions such that build + probe partitions fit in memory. Then, we sub partition further such that sub partition and index fit in L3 cache. This speeds up probe phase.
- Lay out attributes of tuples to maximise cache usage. Store often accessed attributes adjacent to each other.
- Use multiple threads for parallel query processing. Cache miss leads to stall of one thread, but others can proceed.

# ~Chapter 16: Query Optimisation

As we have seen before, there are multiple ways to evaluate a given query. The cost difference can be magnanimous in some cases. A plan is evaluated on cost formulae, statistical information and statistical estimation of intermediate results. Most databases support `explain <query>` that gives the details of the evaluation plan.

## Generating Equivalent Expressions

Two queries are equivalent in the (multi)set version if both of them generate the same (multi)set of tuples on **every legal database instance**. Note that we ignore the order of tuples in relational algebra. 

- Conjunctive selection operations can be deconstructed into a sequence of individual selections

  
  $$
  \sigma_{\theta_1 \land \theta_2}(E) \equiv \sigma_{\theta_1} (\sigma_{\theta_2}(E))
  $$
  

- Selection operations are commutative

  
  $$
  \sigma_{\theta_1} (\sigma_{\theta_2}(E)) \equiv \sigma_{\theta_2} (\sigma_{\theta_1}(E))
  $$
  

- Only the last in a sequence of project operations is needed, the others can be omitted.

  
  $$
  \Pi_{L_1}(\dots(\Pi_{L_n}(E))\dots) \equiv \Pi_{L_1}(E)
  $$
  

- Selections can be combined with Cartesian products and theta joins.

  
  $$
  \begin{align}
  \sigma_{\theta}(E_1 \times E_2) &\equiv E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_2 \\
  \sigma_{\theta_1}(E_1 \bowtie_{\theta_2} E_2) & \equiv  E_1 \bowtie_{\theta_1 \land \theta_2} E_2
  \end{align}
  $$
  

- **Theta-join and natural joins** operations are <u>commutative</u> as well as <u>associative</u>. However, order will not be the same in SQL.

  sc
  $$
  (E_1 \bowtie_{\theta_1} E_2)\bowtie_{\theta_2 \land \theta_3} E_3 \equiv(E_1 \bowtie_{\theta_1 \land \theta_3} E_2)\bowtie_{\theta_2 } E_3
  $$
  

  where $$\theta_2$$ contains attributes only from $$E_2$$ and $$E_3$$.

- $$
  \sigma_{\theta_1 \land \theta_2} (E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_2) \equiv (\sigma_{\theta_1}(E_1)) \bowtie_\theta (\sigma_{\theta_2}(E_2))
  $$

- Projection distributes over join. Throw out useless attributes before joining.

- We also have the usual set operations equivalences. Selection operation distributes over $$\cup, \cap, -$$.

- We can also come up with rules involving left outer join (⟖), aggregations and group by’s.

  
  $$
  \sigma_\theta(E_1 ⟕ E_2) \equiv  (\sigma_\theta(E_1) ⟕ E_2)
  $$
  

  where $$\theta$$ does not involve attributes from $$E_2$$ that are not in $$E_1$$. If it involves only the attributes from $$E_2$$ and is <u>null rejecting</u>, we can convert the left outer join to inner join.

- 

- $$
  _A\gamma_{count(A)}(s_1 \bowtie_{s_1.A = s_2.A}s_2) \equiv \Pi_{A, c_1 \times c_2}(_A\gamma_{count(A)}(s_1) \bowtie_{s_1.A = s_2.A} {_A}\gamma_{count(A)}(s_2)) 
  $$

- $$
  \sigma_\theta({_A}\gamma_{agg(B)}(E)) \equiv {_A}\gamma_{agg(B)}(\sigma_\theta(E))
  $$

  

  where $$\theta$$ uses only attributes from the grouping attributes.

There were 300 rules in SQL server in 2008!
