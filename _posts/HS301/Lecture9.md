> Philosophy is love of knowledge

Socrates had fundamental questions through which he tried to explain the reality. "Life is suffering" - *Buddha*. These questions sustain through time, and are relevant to every living being. 

Some philosophers accept belief as the source of knowledge.

Socrates is an important philosopher but he didn't publish anything. His student, Plato, documented all of Socrates' dialogues and beliefs. Socrates believed in truth, and he went to great lengths to show his belief in his truth. In the end, Socrates accepted death, but did not accept to let go of his truth.

In those days, people visited "Oracles" to know about their future. Oracles were believed to be wise humans who had immense knowledge.
