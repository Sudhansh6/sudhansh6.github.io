## Representing Cardinality Constraints in ER Diagram

We express cardinality constraints by drawing either a directed line $$(\to)$$, signifying ‘one’, or an undirected line $(-)$, signifying ‘many’, between the relationship set and the entity set. 

## Total and Partial Participations

**Total participation** - every entity in the entity set participates in at least one relationship in the relationship set. 

**Partial participation** - some entities may not participate in any relationship in the relationship set.

## Notation for Expressing More Complex Constraints

A line may have an associated minimum and maximum cardinality, shown in the form ‘l..h’. A minimum value of 1 indicates total participation.
