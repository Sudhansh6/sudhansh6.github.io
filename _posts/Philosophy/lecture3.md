## Order in first Philosophy

Aristotle's philosophy is known as the first philosophy. It also refers to metaphysics. This field is divided into 3 branches:

- Science of being *qua being* - ***Ontology*** - General nature of everything
- Highest kind of being - ***Theology*** - Appropriate to divinity
- First principle - ***Universal science*** - True of every existing thing and lie at the basis of all proof or demonstration

> Qua - It is a technical expression Aristotle uses to indicate an aspect under which something is to be considered. The study of being 'qua being' concerns the most general class of things, viz., everything that exists.

The **four causes** or four explanations are, in [Aristotelian thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism), four fundamental types of answer to the question "why?" in the [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_Analytics) of change or movement in nature:

- **Material cause**: "that out of which" it is made.
- **Efficient Cause**: the source of the object's principle of change or stability.
- **Formal Cause**: the essence of the object.
- **Final Cause**: the end/goal of the object, or what the object is good for.

## The controversial turning points

From the 1950s (BC), there was a dramatic change in the notion of knowledge. Some people gained a scornful attitude towards metaphysics. They considered Metaphysics is meaningless for philosophy.

A philosopher called Gracia tried to integrate metaphysics into philosophy. 

"A holistic approach is desirable, but this cannot be reduced to a disorderly aggregate of diverse approaches." (Gracia 2014: 310)

## Epistemology

The term “epistemology” comes from the Greek words “episteme” and “logos”. “Episteme” can be translated as “knowledge” or “understanding” or “acquaintance”. In contrast, “logos” can be translated as “account” or “argument” or “reason”.

### Knowledge as justified true belief

Plato's Theatetus - "Knowledge importantly depends on the nature of knower and her relationship to her environment."
