## Additional closure properties of CFLs

- $$L(G) \cap R$$, where $$R$$ is a regular language, is also context-free.

  How do we show that $$L = \{ww \mid w \in (a + b)^*\}$$ is not context free? It can be shown via pumping lemma which is complicated. However, it is very easy to prove it using the above property.

  How do we prove the closure property? Consider a $$PDA(M_1)$$ for $$L(G)$$ and $$DFA(M_2)$$  for $$R$$. Now, we construct a ‘product’ PDA similar to what we did in NFAs. We use the ‘final state’ accept PDA for the purpose. The final states would be $$F_1 \times F_2$$. It is easy to see that we can get the required property. 

## CYK algorithm

The Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm can be used to check if a string $$w$$ belongs to $$L(G)$$.

Suppose there is a $$w = w_1 w_2 \dots w_i \dots w_l \dots w_n$$ whose membership we need to check. We consider subproblems of the form: Is $$w_{ij} \triangleq w_i \dots w_{i + j - 1}$$ derivable from any non-terminal in the grammar? Then, finally, we need to answer is $$w_{1n}$$ can be derived from $$S$$.

We consider the Chomsky normal form of the grammar for this algorithm. All strings of the form $$w_{j1}$$ can be checked easily. For each $$w_{i1}$$ we store all the non-terminals that can derive it. Now, the recursion for all $$j \geq 2$$ is given by


$$
f(w_{in}) = \bigcup_{j = 1}^{n - 1}\bigcup_{A \in f(w_{ij})} \bigcup_{B \in f(w_{i(n - j)})} \{C \mid (C \to AB) \in G \}
$$


See the following example using the CYK algorithm.

It is easy to see that this algorithm takes $$\mathcal O(n^3)$$.
