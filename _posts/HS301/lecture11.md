Now, we shall study about Plato. As previously discussed, Plato was a disciple of Socrates,

## Plato - Theory of Ideas

The central theme of theory of idea is the *nature of essence* of things and how things are known to us. Socrates was interested in moral knowledge and ethics.  Plato was inclined to know about the definitions of the very concepts discussed by Socrates. He also gave importance to Ontology and Metaphysics. He felt this was missing in Socrates' ideas. Therefore, Metaphysics and Ontology once again came into the discourse of philosophy.

## Plato and his Philosophical problem

Plato tried to compose learnings from other philosophers like Parmenides, Heraclitus and Protagoras. This comprehensive outlook shows the link between epistemology, ontology and ethics - What is the meaning of life and its existence?

- Plato believed that genuine knowledge is changeless, eternal and absolute (from Parmenides).
- Sense experiences vary and therefore sensuous appearances keep changing (from Heraclitus).
- Plato emphasised that the real can comprehended through reason.

## Dialectical Method

Socrates practised this but Plato conceptualised this idea. This method consists of

- Comprehension of scattered particulars into one idea
- The division of the idea into species for generalisation.

In this way, one can follow clear and consistent thinking. This is the foundation of deductive reasoning.

## Concepts, Ideas and Forms

Plato's originality lies in raising the issue of universals. Coming to conclusions using representative of general classes, say, trees. *Similar* because they partake of similarity. Plato makes a distinction between a universal and a particular. 

Forms are a manifestation of similarity. Humans are all similar. A quality of "human-ness". Just and beautiful because they partake of justice and beauty. 

## What is an idea?

Plato disagreed with Parmenides in this topic. Parmenides stated that an idea is not a thought. Plato theorised that idea may be an *object* of thought.  Parmenides believed that there was only one idea. On the other hand, Plato devised that there are multiple ideas and they are indivisible.

Ideas are not known to us, because human knowledge is not absolute - Parmenides. This statement again goes back to Skepticism. Plato said "Ideas are universal and eternal and not subject to change". One can see a horse, but one cannot see "horseness". this inconceivable ontological concept is intelligible. The knowledge of particulars are given to us by the sense experiences, whereas the knowledge of universals is intelligible. Therefore, these ides correspond to abstract concepts. They exists in an *independent realm*, are *non-temporal*, and participate in particulars.

We say ideas are ideas are non-temporal because particulars are temporal/ have finite existence.

## Epistemology and Metaphysics

Plato says **Soul** is the knowledge of *Forms*. Soul is identical to the concept of the mind today. Soul can contemplate on pure eternal ideas. *Knowledge is latent in the soul*.

The idea of Unity and Diversity. The idea of Good is the **Logos**.

> Logos - The principle of divine reason or cosmic order

The meaning of Good cannot be grasped by the senses. Unity (Metaphysical form) of universals and Diversity (Ontological) of particulars. Ideas are only intelligible. They can be grasped by dialectic methods.

For a realist, ideas are an illusion. However, Plato believed ideas are real. Our perception through our senses is not the actual reality. A realist believes in sense experiences. Reality may be different from what we perceive.

Difference between soul and an idea? Soul is the part of human life. Soul is eternal according to Plato. We can relate to forms using our soul. A soul can relate itself to ideas.
