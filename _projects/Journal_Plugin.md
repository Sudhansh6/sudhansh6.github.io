importance: 2
---

The VS Code Journal Plugin addresses developer workflow challenges by integrating features like automated TODO tracking from code, daily note creation with shortcuts, task management (including rollover to subsequent days), and memo-style note-taking akin to Notion. It includes tagging for better file categorization, markdown support, and journal navigation through natural language queries. You can look at the [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZU38_QZEfchCEqnXH5DwiKEVNywBzhkN/view?usp=share_link) to see the plugin in action.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/8xEngineers/cse210-fa24-group12/tree/main). The code is inspired from the original [VS Code Journal Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pajoma.vscode-journal).
