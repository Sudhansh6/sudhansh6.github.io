Let us go back to the $$L = \{a^nb^nc^n\}$$ language. How do we come up with a deterministic grammar? We use the idea of **markers**.

  $$
  \begin{align}
  S &\to S_1$ \\
  S_1 &\to ABC \mid ABCS_1 \\
  CA &\to AC \\
  CB &\to BC \\
  BA &\to AB \\
  C$ &\to c ,\;  Cc \to cc \\
  Bc &\to bc ,\; Bc \to bb \\
  Ab &\to ab ,\; Aa \to aa \\
  \end{align}
  $$
  
  
  The problem with the above grammar is obvious. This issue is often prevented using priority rules in hierarchical grammars. Another fix for this is, adding the following set of rules
  
  
  $$
  \begin{align}
  Ca &\to aC ,\; ca \to ac\\
  Cb &\to bC ,\; cb \to bc\\
  Ba &\to aB ,\; ba \to ab
  \end{align}
  $$

### TM as a recogniser

Are the set of moves on a TM a decision procedure? A decision procedure refers to a procedure that outputs yes or no for a given input.  It involves *correctness* and *termination*. No, TM does not do that. For example, consider never halting TMs. Therefore, TM is a semi-decision procedure. In order to classify TM as a decision procedure, we need to show that it halts on every input. Also, we need to show that it gives the correct answer.

### TM as a “computer”

Can TM replicate any function of the form $$y = f(X_1, \dots, X_n)$$ where the arguments belong to $\mathbb N$. Yes, it can be done. What should a Turing machine do when we give invalid arguments to partial functions? It should never halt. On total functions, the TM must always halt and give the correct answer. For example, we have the following TM for $$f(x, y) = max(0, x - y)$$. Numbers $$x$$ and $$y$$ are written consecutively on the tape in unary form separated by a $$1$$.
