### Database Architecture

There are various architectures such as centralized databases, client-server, parallel databases and distributed databases.

### Attributes

The set of allowed values for each attribute is called the **domain** of the attribute. Attribute values are required to be *atomic* - indivisible. Todd realized that having sets or divisible attributes complicates the algebra. The special value ***null*** is a member of every domain that indicates the value is unknown. The null values causes complications in the definition of many operations.

Relations are **unordered**. The order of tuples is irrelevant for the operations logically. 

**Database Schema** - The logical structure of the database. 

### Keys

*K* is a **superkey** of the relation *R* if values for *K* are sufficient to identify a unique tuple of each possible relation $$r(R)$$. Superkey $$K$$ is a **candidate key** if $$K$$ is minimal. One of the candidate keys is selected to be the **primary key**. A **foreign key** constraint ensures that the value in one relation must appear in another. There is a notion of *referencing* relation and a *referenced* relation.

### Relational Query Languages

Pure languages include Relational algebra, Tuple relational calculus and Domain relational calculus. These three languages are equivalent in computing power.
