# ~Chapter 19: 

A transaction failure can occur as a result of 

- logical errors - internal error condition in the transaction. These can be somewhat prevented by `assert` statements.
- system error - database must terminate the transaction due to errors like deadlock.

**System crash** - Occurs due to a power failure, hardware or software failure. A **failstop assumption** refers to the assumptions that non-volatile storage contents are not corrupted by a system crash. A **disk failure** destroys disk storage.

Logging helps in recovery. To recover from failure, we first find inconsistent blocks by

- We compare two copies of every disk block which is expensive, or
- Use logs sort of mechanism

and then overwrite the inconsistent blocks.
