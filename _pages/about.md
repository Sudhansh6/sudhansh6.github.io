Hello! I'm Sudhansh, a second-year Masters in Computer Science student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). I am a graduate of [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering with honors and pursued a minor in Entrepreneurship.

I worked with [Prof. Henrik Christensen](http://hichristensen.net) on real-time dense 3D SLAM approaches based on NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting along with some traditional techniques. Furthermore, we submitted a conference paper to [ICRA '25](https://2025.ieee-icra.org) on a novel table-top rearrangement algorithm addressing the limitations of scalability and optimal performance with the current available algorithms. 
  
AT IIT Bombay, I worked with [Prof. Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/) on the Likelihood Maximization method for Saturation Compressed Sensing. We published a journal paper in [Elsevier Signal Processing 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168423004231) based on this work. Moreover, we have submitted a paper to [ICASSP '24](https://2025.ieeeicassp.org) on identifiction and correction of permutation errors in compressed-sensing based [group testing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34812422/). 

In addition to this, I have worked with [Prof. Marta Betcke](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/M.Betcke.html) from University College London on Stochastic Primal Dual algorithms for Tomographic Reconstruction of 3D volumes in Low-Dose conditions, and we have a journal paper in preparation.
