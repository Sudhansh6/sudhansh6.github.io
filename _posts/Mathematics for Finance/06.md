## Call-Put Parity

A call option is represented as $$C_T = (S_T - K)^+$$ and a put option is represented as $$P_T = (K - S_T)^+ = (S_T - K)^-$$.

For any $$b$$, we have $$b^+ - b^- = b$$ and $$b^+ + b^- = b$$. In other words, the payoffs in call and put options are related to each other as

$$
\begin{align*}
C_T - P_T = S_T - K \\
C_T + K = S_T + P_T
\end{align*}
$$

**Claim.** For $$t < T$$, we have

$$
C_t + \frac{K}{(1 + r)^{T - t}} = S_t + P_t
$$

This result can be proved using **One price principle**. Think of each side of the equation as separate investments

1. First investment has a call option and bonds with $$K$$. 

2. Second investment has a put option and one share of the stock

We can see that at time $$T$$, the values become equal $$C_T + K = S_T + P_T$$

# American Options

In American Options, we have $$Y_0, Y_1, \dots, Y_T$$ random payouts where each $$Y_t \in \mathcal F_T$$. The holder of the options can take the payment at any time $$t \in [0, T]$$ of choice. That is , unlike European options, American options have the choice of payment at any intermediate time. For example, consider a call option $$Y_t = (S_t - K)^+$$ for $$t = 0, \dots, T$$. 

Formally, we have the **stopping time** property represented as  $$\mathcal T: \Omega \to \{0, 1, \dots, T\}$$ such that $$\{\mathcal T \leq t\} = \{w \in \Omega: \mathcal T(W) \leq t\} \in \mathcal F_t, \forall t = 0, 1, \dots, T$$. This is equivalent to saying, $$\{T = t\} \in \mathcal F_t, \forall t$$.  

For example, consider $$Z_0, Z_1, \dots, Z_T$$, we have $$\mathcal T:= \min \{t: Z_T \in B\} \wedge T$$ where $$A \wedge b = \min(a, b)$$. Then, $$\{\mathcal T = t\} = \{Z_0 \not\in B, Z_1 \not\in B, \dots, Z_{t - 1} \not \in B, Z_t \in B\} \in \mathcal F_t$$.

### Optional Stopping Theorem

Consider a stopping time $$\tau$$ and a Martingale $$(M_t)$$, we have $$\mathbb E(M_\tau) = \mathbb E(M_0)$$. Essentially, in a fair game, the average payout from exiting the option at an intermediate time is the same as the average payout till time $$t= T$$. 

Here $$M_\tau$$ is a random variable of the form $$M_{\tau(w)}(w)$$ which we have represented in a singular form. 

Is the converse true? That is, a sequence of random variables have the optional stopping property where expectations are the same for the beginning and an intermediate time. Then do they constitute a Martingale? Yes, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
M_T &= M_0 + \sum_{t = 1}^T (M_t - M_{t - 1}) \\
M_\tau &= M_0 + \sum_{t = 1}^T (M_t - M_{t - 1}) \mathbb 1_{\{t \leq \tau\}}
\end{align*}
$$

The event $$\{t \leq \tau\}$$ is equivalent to $$\{\tau \leq t - 1\}^c$$. This allows us to get back the notion of $$\mathcal F_{t - 1}$$ 

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb E(M_\tau) &= \mathbb E(M_0) + \sum_{t = 1}^T \mathbb E[(M_t - M_{t - 1} \mathbb 1_{\{t \leq \tau\}}] \\
&= \mathbb E(M_0) + \sum_{t = 1}^T \mathbb E[\mathbb E[(M_t - M_{t - 1} \mathbb 1_{\{t \leq \tau\}} \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1}]] \\
&= \mathbb E(M_0) + \sum_{t = 1}^T \mathbb E[\mathbb E[(M_t - M_{t - 1}  \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1}] \mathbb 1_{\{t \leq \tau\}}] \\
&= \mathbb E(M_0)
\end{align*} 
$$

Let us consider an example of an American Put option to understand this better -

$$
Y_t = (K - S_t)^+
$$

where $$T = 1, u = 2, d = 0.5, r = 0.2, S_0 = 100, K = 150$$. The value for $$p^*$$ is $$7/15$$. Then, we have the following tree evolution for $$S_t$$

$$
\begin{align*}
&100 \\
50 &\quad 100 \\
25 \quad 100 &\quad 100 \quad 400

\end{align*}
$$

The payment $$Y_t$$ looks like 

$$
\begin{align*}
&50 \\
100^{1} &\quad 0 \\
125 \quad 50 &\quad 50 \quad 0

\end{align*}
$$

How do we calculate a fair price in this case? We introduce the notion of a **super-martingale**. In comparison, in European call options, we get for $$V_t$$

$$
\begin{align*}
&41.98 \\
75^{1} &\quad 22.\bar 2 \\
125 \quad 50 &\quad 50 \quad 0

\end{align*}
$$

From the seller's perspective, we have $$U_t$$, and we use something called as a **necessary wealth** process - calculating the amount of money the seller requires at every node to pay the option holder. To do so, we need to consider the maximum of all possible payouts at every node. In the node labeled $$1$$ above, if the buyer exits the option at $$t = 1$$, then the seller needs a payout of $$100$$. However, if the buyer exits at time $$t = 2$$, the seller requires atleast $$75$$ at $$t = 1$$ (They can invest the $$75$$ in the same stock using short sell to get the required payouts). Considering these scenarios, the seller requires $$100$$ at the $$1$$ node. Doing such a process for every node, we get $$U_t$$

$$
\begin{align*}
&53.09 \\
100 &\quad 22.\bar 2 \\
125 \quad 50 &\quad 50 \quad 0

\end{align*}
$$

We can see that the price of this option is slightly higher than European since the buyer has the choice of exiting the contract at any intermediate time. 

To formally describe the process we did above, we consider the following *recursion*

$$
\begin{align*}
    U_{t - 1} &= \max \left(\frac{1}{1 + r} \mathbb E^*(U_t \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1}), Y_{t - 1}\right) \quad t = T, T - 1, \dots, 1 \\
U^*_{t - 1} &= \max\left(\mathbb E^*(U^*_t \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1}), Y^*_{t - 1}\right) \\
&\geq \mathbb E^*(U^*_t \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1})
\end{align*}
$$

The variables $$U^*_{t} = U_t (1 + r)$$ are called as **super-martingales**.
