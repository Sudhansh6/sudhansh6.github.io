How do we put the divided differences method into practice? The recursive argument of the method was based on the difference between $$p_n$$ and $$p_{n + 1}$$. So, we have the following theorem.

***Theorem.*** If $$f[a,b] \to \mathbb R, x_0, \dots, x_n \in [a, b]$$ be given as usual and let $$p_n$$ be the corresponding interpolating polynomial. Then, for any point $$x \in [a,b]$$,


$$
f(x) = p_n(x) + (x - x_0)(x - x_1)\dots (x - x_n)f[x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n, x]
$$


We shall not cover the proof of this theorem but the intuition can be drawn from the divided difference method. This theorem can be used to get the error form of the divided differences method.

## Osculating Polynomials

Let $$f:[a, b] \to \mathbb R$$ be continuously differentiable for $$r \gg 0$$. 

**Taylor’s theorem** gives us a polynomial $$Q(x)$$ at $$x_0 \in [a, b]$$ such that 


$$
\frac{d^k f(x_0)}{dx^k} = \frac{d^k Q(x_0)}{dx^k}
$$




for $$k = 0, \dots, m$$ for $$m \leq r$$.

**Lagrange’s theorem** gives a polynomial $$P_k$$ at distinct $$x_0, \dots, x_k$$ in $$[a, b]$$ such that 


$$
f(x_i) = P_k(x_i)
$$


for $$i = 0, \dots, k$$. 

Can we get both these properties for the interpolating polynomial? Let $$f$$ be as above, $$x_0, \dots, x_n$$ be distinct nodes in $$[a, b]$$ and assume that for each node $$x_i$$ an integer $$m_i \geq 0$$ is prescribed. Is there a polynomial $$P(x)$$ such that 


$$
\frac{d^k f(x_i)}{dx^k} = \frac{d^k P(x_i)}{dx^k}
$$




for $$k = 0, \dots, m_i$$ and $$i  = 0, \dots, n$$? Such a polynomial is called the **osculating polynomial** for $$f$$.
