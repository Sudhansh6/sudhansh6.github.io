## Introduction to Philosophy

What is Philosophy? It is a humanistic discipline that investigates into the nature of values and relationship that integrates humanity with or Reality as a whole. It is the love of knowledge about the nature of reality, mind, values, etc. A philosopher needs to understand the very development of such a knowledge system.

### The source of origin of philosophy

All knowledge systems developed from human/thinking thoughts. Speculating about he very nature of existence is the basis of **philosophical thinking**. 

## Philosophical Thinking

Philosophical investigation is conceptual. Philosophers think through concepts and their effort is to make sense of experiences and ideas concerning the subject matter. Philosophical thinking is speculative, Imaginative/creative, Reflective/Critical, Argumentative and liberal/inclusive

### Speculative thinking

Knowledge is not just merely based on experience, but **intuitive insights** which go beyond the experience of observable facts. It highlights the power of imagination in forming or visualising something - the existence of the underlying principle. For example, Pythagoras used numbers to speculate about reality. Thales theorised that five fundamental elements constitute reality.

Imagination is the spirit of discovery/invention. 

### Creative Thinking

Rabindranath Tagore was a poet, philosopher and his poems are one of the finest expression of creativity that aspired to grasp truth.

### Reflective/critical thinking

Many philosophers and philosophical traditions accept critical thinking as a method of doing philosophy. It involves evaluation of information, objective analysis of thoughts, skilful application of concepts and synthesis of ideas.

### Argumentative thinking

Philosophical thinking  involves arguments. Logic takes us from one set of thoughts to another set of thoughts.

### Liberal and inclusive

Philosophy would have been a disaster if people were not open minded/ receptive to new ideas and thoughts. Although, sometimes dominant philosophical traditions prevail - Philosophical Blindness.

Philosophical enterprise demands self-scrutiny to eliminate prejudices and dogmas and also competitions - *R. Solomon 2001:100*.

## Metaphysics

Metaphysics was the central idea of philosophical discourse. Philosophy began with metaphysical inquiries. It raises certain fundamental questions regarding the universe and man's existence in it.

Metaphysics talk about everything that exists or may exist. It is also known as *the first philosophy*. 

There were some controversial turning points in the evolution of metaphysics. During the renaissance in the 17th century, the tough minded philosophers disrupted the glow of metaphysical thinking.

### Aristotle: Metaphysics as First Philosophy

He wrote a Treatise on Metaphysics - *ta meta ta physica*. The Order in First Philosophy is discussed [here](#order-in-first-philosophy) in lecture 3. 

Metaphysics has the power of integrating knowledge across all fields of science. Therefore, it still has relevance in the contemporary world.

Now, we begin studying various philosopher and their philosophies

# Thales (624-546 BC) - Thales of Miletus

He is known as the First Philosopher. His the founder of Ionian School of Science. Thales motivated people to think about reality keeping aside religion and mythical wisdom.

## What did Thales pursue

He embarked upon study of things. He awakened people to their awareness. He questioned the existing system of knowledge and the frameworks of misunderstanding. He evoked a desire to find out the right knowledge. 

He wanted to study reality as *it is* and not how it *appears*.

## Everything is Water

Water has no shape, no form of its own. Thales made the remark that water is something vital, and necessary for the generation and growth of all things.
