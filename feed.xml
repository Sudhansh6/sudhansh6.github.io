From notes, scales, rhythms, chords, time signatures, and many more abstract concepts associated with music, it is an interesting problem to capture the interactions between music pieces. This problem requires concepts from signal processing</p> <p>How is music represented? A Mel spectrogram is used to represent frequencies across time with amplitudes for audio files. A MIDI file is a tabular description of beats, positions, pitch, durations and instruments. These tabular instances can easily be converted to vector representations using one-hot encodings and feature normalization.</p> <p>Using such representations, the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06983">Multitrack Music Transformer</a> attempts to capture the interactions with attention mechanisms in a transformer. To understand this better, let us look at some theory.</p> <h3 id="total-information-flow">Total Information Flow</h3> <p>The total information flow is the sum of transfer entropies from $X$ to $Y$ and $Y$ to $X$.</p> \[T_{X \to Y} + T_{Y \to X} = H(X \vert \bar X) + H(Y \vert \bar Y) - H(XY \vert \bar{XY})\] <p>If the combined sequence $XY$ does not make sense musically, then it will have a higher entropy, leading to lower total information flow. This concept is explored in depth in this context in this paper - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06810">Evaluating Co-Creativity using Total Information Flow</a>.</p> <h3 id="conditional-entropy">Conditional Entropy</h3> <p>Represented as $H(Y \vert X)$ it measures how unpredicatble $Y$ is, given that we have $X$. How is this useful? A pre-trained music transformer is used to model $p(X \vert \bar X)$ which represents the probability of a particular <em>token</em> (next part of music) after seeing a particular set of tokens (music till that point).</p> <h2 id="research">Research</h2> <p>Using the features from a MIDI file directly would not yield the best results. It composes of monotonically increasing data (beat), categorical features (instruments) and repeated values (position).</p> <p>This problem can also be posed as a Reinforcement Learning Problem - using total information flow as a reward. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03082">RL-Duet: Online Music Accompaniment Generation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</a> formulated a Deep RL algorithm for online accompaniment generation. The generation agent learns a policy to generate a musical note (action) based on previously generated context (state). RL has potential for real-time human-machine duel improvisation.</p> <h1 id="rl-duet">RL-Duet</h1> <p>What is the goal? Create an agent that can generate music <em>interactively</em> with a human. Again, this is done via Symbolic MIDI pitch + beat. The earlier approaches used GANs which have large data requirements and usntable training. Another approach, using Gibbs sampling, iteratively modifies the music fragments based on the previous context. However, this approach cannot be done in an online fashion.</p> <p>Typical approaches in reinforcement learning for sequence generation use maximum likelihood estimation. However, to improve the perceptual quality, global coherence and harmony, specific hand-crafted music rules-based rewards work much better.</p> <p>The work in RL-Duet captures the horizontal temporal consistency and vertical harmony relations for the reward function of the RL-agent. The current state is the previously generated context (by both human and the agent) and the action as mentioned before is symbolic MIDI (note and pitch). This involves horizontal view (like linear bi-directional language modeling in NLP), vertical part, joint modeling and hand-crafted rewards.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Research"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capturing the quantifiers required to comment on how well two pieces of music complement each other.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reinforcement Learning in Nuclear Fusion</title><link href="https://sudhansh6.github.io/blog/Control-for-Nuclear-Fusion/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reinforcement Learning in Nuclear Fusion"/><published>2024-05-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sudhansh6.github.io/blog/Control-for-Nuclear-Fusion</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sudhansh6.github.io/blog/Control-for-Nuclear-Fusion/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1> <p>What is Nuclear fusion? A process where lighter nuclei combine to form heavier atoms. It is of interest to researchers because of its potential to provide clean and long-term energy source. Humans are able to (atleast trying) perform these reactions by carefully controlling plasma through magnetic fields. Plasma is a state of matter where the electrons are stripped from their atoms past a certain temperature. These are extremely hot and require precisely controlled magnetical fields to be stored.</p> <h2 id="fusion-methods">Fusion Methods</h2> <p>There are two methods through which nuclear fusion is being performed currently -</p> <ul> <li> <p>Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF)</p> <ul> <li>These facilities tend to be very large, and are impractical to scale.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF)</p> <ul> <li>The goal is to confine hot plasma without touching walls. The device used for this is called as a <strong>tokamak</strong> that uses a central solenoid and induced current to control the magnetic fields.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="tokamak">Tokamak</h3> <p>It’s a sonu shaped device with a central solenoid that generates toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields to confine plasma and maintain high temperatures. Through these fields we want to control the radial position, vertical extent and overall shape of the plasma which is important for the fusion reactions.</p> <p>Recently, KSTAR in South Korea was able to confine plasma for about a minute which is an impressive result for the current sota. In a huge international effort, ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), the world’s largest tokamak is currently being built in Southern France.</p> <h3 id="controls-engineering-process">Controls Engineering Process</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Feedforward stage</strong> - Find the ideal setting for fusion experiment objectives - precompute coil curents, plasma shape, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Feedback control stage</strong> - Closed loop control with magnetic measurements to determine the state of the plasma. Maintaining the required state boils down to solving a nonlinear PDE.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="better-control">Better control</h2> <p>Tradtional algorithms are able to control the vertical position of the plasma really well but they can be improved for radial control and are a result of intricately designed controllers stiched together. A black-box AI solution shows promise as a single control policy for more robust non-linear control. However, there can be a lack of performance guarantees along with non-interpretability with AI algorithms.</p> <p>To emphasise on safety certifications, there has been works using Lyapunov functions.</p> <h3 id="stability-guarantees">Stability Guarantees</h3> <p><strong>Lyapunov</strong> functions are scalar functions used to verify stability of a system by modeling evolution of system moving from one energy level to another. Recently, work in Neural Lyapunov controls has extended these stability guarantees with the use of neural networks.</p> <h3 id="deep-reinforcement-learning-approaches">Deep Reinforcement Learning Approaches</h3> <p>“<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04301-9">Magnetic control of tokamak plasmas through deep reinforcement learning</a>” by Degrace aims to provide a solution for feedback control stage by estimating the current state using various measurements. The challenge arises in modelling such a high-dimensional space - 92 system measurements (poloidal coil currents, flux loops, magnetic probes) and the actions are continuous (19 control coil voltages) and also the absence of a good simulator for this problem.</p> <p>The authors use a simulated environment which is implemented using a Forward FRad-Shafranov solve (FGE). Their algorithm was able to maintain different shapes of the plasma which is not possible with conventional algorithms.</p> <p>Another paper by KSTAR - <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ac79be">Development of an operation trajectory design algorithm for control of multiple 0D parameters using deep reinforcement learning in KSTAR</a> - used <em>TD3</em> (RL algorithm) for feedforward controls. That is, to estimate the desired state of plasma required for the experiments. The states capture “how well the fusion reaction is going”, the safety indices, etc to determine the required controls.</p> <p>Interestingly, instead of a physics-based simulator, they used a data-based simulator trained using an LSTM network on around 5 years of data.</p> <h2 id="current-work">Current Work</h2> <p><strong>Neural Lyapunov control</strong> - Roughly, we want to generate a lyapunov risk formulation for the fusion environment. The challenge is the for the fusion environment, we do not know the system dynamics, and we want to build a neural approximation for estimating this value. This can then be used for the lyapunov risk, which can finally be used for the control algorithms <em>with safety guarantees</em>.

It involves behavior planning and path planning algorithms. Behavior planning involves predicting motion of objects on the road and analysing the traffic signs. The path planning part involves generating multiple trajectories which are pruned down from the perception data (sorting them based on a cost function).</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="behavior-planning">Behavior Planning</h2> <h3 id="state-diagram-algorithms">State Diagram Algorithms</h3> <p>Some classical approaches for this problem involves state diagrams that have a deterministic policy based on symbolic descriptions of the world. Basically, think of these as complicated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if-else</code> structures. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4290200/">Behavior Nets</a> is one of the state-of-the-art approaches in this realm.</p> <p>However, these approaches are prone to errors due to sensor uncertainity, state uncertainiity, uncertain temporal evolution and occlusions. These are corrected using Markov Decision Processes</p> <h3 id="markov-decision-processing">Markov Decision Processing</h3> <p>They involve deterministic or stochastic policy within a framework that models uncertainty by evaluating the future. The MDPs are coupled with a risk-factor to make the optimal strategy the safe strategy. One such approach is listed in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6082928">Probabilistic MDP-behavior planning for cars</a>. However, these do not work quite well in dynamic world. Also, in dense scenes the dimensionality becomes very high making this approach unscalable. The number of agent vary as well which cannot be modeled completely using an MDP.</p> <p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04697">Behavior Planning at Urban Intersections through Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</a> the authors simply choose the nearest $5$ agents to model the algorithm and use an RL algorithm to plan the path. However, this approach is data hungry, requires simulators, has low data coverage and oversimplifies the information in dense scenes.</p> <h3 id="online-algorithms">Online Algorithms</h3> <p>In <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2017/664">Online Decision-Making for Scalable Autonomous Systems (MODIA)</a> the algorithm decomposes the dynamic scene into small decision problems for each agent in the environment. Each decision problem has a pre-defined MDP based on the class of the agent. After obtaining optimal actions from each of these problems, an <em>executor</em> finds the best action based on a <em>preference</em> function defined on a notion of safety. This way, the algorithm has a linearly-growing complexity and state abstractions which are explainable.</p> <h2 id="status-quo">Status-Quo</h2> <p>Taking a step back, we need to deal with dynamic and complex environments. We need to ensure the algorithms use limited computation power and work with the variety of sensors equipped in the vehicle.</p> <p>We do not have a good behavior-realisitc simulator and sufficient human labor annotations (in academic labs). Without enough data, how do we build algorithms for planning? The AVL Lab at UCSD does the following -</p> <ul> <li> <p>Collect rollouts - Data collection stack for behavior planning - point cloud maps, teleoperation platform that collects high and low-level control</p> </li> <li> <p>Training phase - Offline RL for each decision problem</p> </li> <li> <p>Real-world deployment - Online decision framework from MODIA.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This approach has many limitations. Since the number of states is very large, the state-transition matrix is very sparse, and this is not good for determining the optimal policy. These can be fixed using generative simulators (which do not work quite well cuurently) or bridging large dataset by outsourcing the data collection.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Research"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discussion on algorithms for predicting behavior patters in dense urban scenes.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Structural Visualization for Neural Networks</title><link href="https://sudhansh6.github.io/blog/Structural-Visualization-for-Neural-Network/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Structural Visualization for Neural Networks"/><published>2024-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sudhansh6.github.io/blog/Structural-Visualization-for-Neural-Network</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sudhansh6.github.io/blog/Structural-Visualization-for-Neural-Network/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1> <p>The structure of neural networks have been motivated from neurons in brains.

The field has deep and attractive scientific problems, which have been advancing at a rapid pace in the past few years.<br/> In the early days of research, the focus in vision was on engineering “good” features coupled with a optimisation algorithm or a shallow neural network. As the processors became more powerful, the emphasis shifted to end-to-end approaches with inclusion of self-supervision and multi-modal learning paradigms.</p> <p>It is often helpful to breakdown the perception tasks into known-algorithms. For example, in autonomous driving, the tasks include SLAM (visual, Structure from Motion), path planning (lane detection, obstacle detection, 3D localization), Semantic segmentation etc. Similarly, the tasks in augmented reality devices are gaze tracking, material and lighting estimation, head pose estimation, depth estimation, etc.</p> <p>Deep learning has opened new areas of research in vision. Features such as generation of high-quality content, end-to-end training, data-driven priors and highly parallelizable architectures have proven advantageous for many problems in computer vision. However, it is also important to note the limitations of these techniques -</p> <ul> <li>Large scale labeled data is not always available</li> <li>Lack of generalization to unseen domains</li> <li>Good at narrow “classification”, not at broad “reasoning”</li> <li>Lack of interpretability</li> <li>Lack of reliability, security or privacy guarantee</li> </ul> <p>To counter these problems, we typically couple our algorithms with self-supervision, physical modelling, multi-modal learning and <em>foundation models</em>. In the recent years, these techniques have been applied to various problems, and the following are arguably the biggest advances in Computer Vision -</p> <ul> <li>Vision Transformers</li> <li>Vision-Language Models</li> <li>Diffusion Models</li> <li>Neural Rendering</li> </ul> <p>These techniques show promise to solve keystone problems in augmented reality, interactive robotics, and autonomous driving. The course will cover the following these topics, along with other fundamentals required.</p> <blockquote> <p>Demonstrate code in presentation</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="neural-architectures">Neural Architectures</h3> <p>The motivation for an artificial neuron (perceptron), comes from a biological neuron where the output is linear combination of the inputs combined with a non-linear activation function. From here, we develop multi-layer networks which are again motivated from the Hubel and Weisel’s architecture in biological cells.</p> <h3 id="neural-networks">Neural Networks</h3> <p>The simplest neural network is a perceptron represented by \(\sigma (x) = \text{sign}(\sum_i w_i x_i + b)\) where the optimal weight values are obtained using an unconstrained optimization problem. These concepts can be extended for “Linear Regression” and “Logistic Regression” tasks.</p> <p>Non-linearity in neural networks is introduced through <strong>Activation functions</strong> such as</p> <ul> <li>Sigmoid - Have vanishing gradient issues</li> <li>tanh - Centered version of sigmoid</li> <li>ReLU - Simplest non-linear activation, with easy gradient calculation.</li> <li>ELU - Added to prevent passive neurons.</li> </ul> <p>At the <strong>output layer</strong>, we apply a final non-linear function is applied to calculate the <strong>loss</strong> in the predicted output. Typically for <strong>classification problems</strong>, <em>Softmax</em> function is used to map the network outputs to probabilities. One-hot representations are not differentiable, and are hence not used for this task. In image synthesis problems, the output layer usually has \(255*sigmoid(z)\).</p> <p><strong>Theorem (Universal function approximators)</strong>: A two-layer network with a sufficient number of neurons can approximate any continous function to any desired accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Width or Depth?</strong> A wider network needs more and more neurons to represent arbitrary function with high enough precision. A deeper network on the contrary, require few parameters needed to achieve a similar approximation power. However, “overly deep” plain nets do not perform well. This is due to the vanishing gradient problem, wherein we are not able to train deep networks with the typical optimization algorithms.</p> <h3 id="convolution-networks">Convolution Networks</h3> <p>The neural network architecture is modified for images using “learnable kernels” in convolutional neural networks. Each convolution layer consists of a set of kernels that produce feature maps from the input. These feature maps capture the <em>spatial</em> and <em>local</em> relationships in the input which is crucial for images.</p> <p>The <em>induction bias</em> in images is that neighbouring variables are locally correlated. An image need not be 2D, it can consist of multiple channels (RGB, hyperspectral, etc.), and convolutional layers work <em>across all</em> these channels to produce feature maps.</p> <p>In a classical neural network, each pixel in the input image would be connected to every neuron in the network layer leading to <em>many</em> parameters for a single image. Using kernels, we use <em>shared weights</em> across all pixel locations, and this greatly reduces the number of learnable parameters without losing much information.</p> <p>Convolution layers are generally accompanies with <strong>Pooling layers</strong> which do not have any learnable parameters, and are used to reduce the size of the output. These layers are invariant to small (spatial)transformations in the input and help observe a larger <em>receptive field</em> in the next layer. The latter property is important to observe hidden layers in the feature maps.</p> <p><strong>Receptive Field</strong> - It is the area in the input iamge “seen” by a unit in a CNN. Inits with deeper layers will have wider receptive fields whereas wider receptive fields allow more global reasoning across entire image. This way, the pooling leads to more rapid widening of receptive fields. We need \(\mathcal O(n/k)\) layers with \((k \times k)\) convolutional filters to have a receptive field of \(n\) in the input. <em>Dilation layers</em> are used to achieve the same receptive field with \(\mathcal O(\log n)\) layers.</p> <p>However, in practice, the empirical receptive fields in the deeper networks is lower than the theoretical value due to sparse weights.</p> <p>Convolution networks are augmented with <em>dense</em> layers to get the output, to learn from the feature maps.</p> <p>The vanishing gradient problem in deeper networks has been solved using <strong>skip connections</strong> wherein the features from the earlier layers are concatenated with the deeper ones to allow passage of information. This way, we provide the network with the original input allowing it to learn the smaller fluctuations in the input (rather than focusing on learning the input itself).</p> <p>In summary, the key operations in convolutional layers are</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Input image -&gt; Convlution -&gt; Non-linearity -&gt; Spatial Pooling -&gt; Feature Maps</code></p> <p>CNNs have the above set of operations repeated many times.

Conventional image processing algorithms relied on a pyramidal representation of features, and this methodology has also paved its way in CNNs.</li> <li>Good inductive biases - Remarkable in transferring knowledge across tasks.

This design decision comes from preferring deeper networks over wider networks. For example, \((1 \times 1)\) kernels are reduce the dimension in the channels dimension.</li> <li>Skip connections allow easier optimization with greater depth.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Why are (1, 1) kernels useful? Use fewer channels instead?</p> </blockquote> <h1 id="transformers">Transformers</h1> <p>Transformers have shown better results in almost every task that CNNs have shone previously in. CNNs require significant depth or larger kernels to share information between non-local spatial locations (recall receptive fields).</p> <p>Many tasks, such as question-answering, require <em>long-range</em> reasoning and transformers are very good at this. For example, placing objects in augmented reality requires reasoning about light-sources, surface estimation, occlusion/shadow detection, etc. This is the primary intuition behind <strong>attention mechanism</strong> which is representative of foveated vision in humans.</p> <p><img src="../../assets/img/Computer Vision/2024-04-11-12-10-13-image.png" alt=""/></p> <p><strong>Tokens</strong> - A data type than can be understood as a set of neurons obtained from vectorizing patches of an image. Typically need not be vectors, but they can be any structured froup that alows a set of differentiable operations. Note that these tokens in hidden layers might not correspond to pixels or interpretable attributes.</p> <p>The following captures a very good intuition for transformers.</p> <p><em>A transformers acts on tokens similarly as neural network acts on neurons. That is, combining tokens is same as for neurons, except tokens are vectors \(t_{out }= \sum_i w_i t_i\). In neural networks, linear layers are represented by \(x_{out} = W x_{in}\) and \(W\) is data-free, whereas in transformers, \(T_{out} = AT_{in}\), \(A\) depends on the data (attention). Again, non-linearity in neural networks is implemented via functions like ReLU whereas transformers use dense layers for non-linearity (applied token wise).</em></p> <p>The attention layer is a spsecial kind of linear transformation of tokens, wherein the attention function \(A = f(.)\) tells how much importance to pay to each token depending on the input query and other signals. <em>Attention-maps</em> help us visualize the global dependencies in the information. The required information is embedded in some dimension of the token representation. For example, the first dimension can count the number of horses in an iamge, and the bottom 3 dimensions can encode the color of the horse on the right. Attention has this flexibility to different allocations address different parts of a query. They can “attend” to only certain patches <em>which are important to the query</em>. This kind of functionality is difficult with CNNs.</p> <blockquote> <p>Apply embedding and neural network (before CNNs and Transofrmers)? Same number of parameters? Essentially similar thing? Associated higher weight to more related embedding.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="query-key-value-attention">Query-Key-Value Attention</h3> <p>The mechanisms described previously are implemented by projecting tokens into queries, keys and values. Each of these are a vector of dimensions $p$, where $p &lt; d$. The <strong>query</strong> vector for the question is used to weigh the <strong>key</strong> vector for each token to obtain the <strong>values</strong>. This is done via computing the similarity between query and each key, and then the <em>attention</em> is given by the extent of similarities, normalized with softmax. The output token is obtained by summing all value vectors with weights assigned from the previous calculations. Roughly, the process looks like -</p> \[\begin{align*} \left. \begin{align*} q = W_q t \\ K_i = W_k t_i \end{align*} \right\} \implies s_i = q^T k_i \\ a_i = softmax(s_i) \\ t_{out} = \sum a_i v_i \end{align*}\] <p>The purpose of “values” is to ‘project’ back the similarities between queries and keys to the ‘token space’.</p> <p>Also note that, if the patch-size is too large, then we might lose the information within the patches. This is a tradeoff, and the decision is made based on the task at hand. For example, classification may work with large patches but tasks such as segmentation may not.</p> <h4 id="self-attention">Self-Attention</h4> <p>How do we learn implicit representations that can work with general queries? We compute <em>self-attention</em> using the image tokens as the queries - information derived from the image itself. How does this process help us? For example, if we are performing instance segmentation of an image with horses. Then, the concept of ‘horse’ is learned by attending more to tother horse tokens and less to background. Similarly, ‘a particular instance’ is learned by attending less to the tokens from other horses. When we do this for all pairs across \(N\) tokens gives us an \(N \times N\) attention matrix.</p> <p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation.png" title="" alt="" width="307"/></p> <p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png" title="" alt="" width="393"/></p> <p>Typically, this matrix is computed in the <strong>encoder</strong> part of a transformer. This matrix is then used in the decoder with an input query to obtain the required results.</p> <h3 id="encoders">Encoders</h3> <p>An encoder of a transformer typically consists of many identical blocks connected serially with one another. Each such encoder block, computes a self-attention matrix and passes it through a feed-forward neural network, and they need to be applied across all the tokens in the input. Since the embeddings of tokens are independent of one another, each level of encoder blocks can be applied <em>in parallel</em> to all the tokens (patches in vision transformers) to obtain the embeddings. Such parallel computations were not possible in previous models like RNNs, which heavily relied on sequential dependencies.</p> <p>The original transformers paper normalizes the similarities with \(\sqrt{N}\) where \(N\) is the embedding dimension. This allows the gradients to stabilise and gives much better performance. This a simplified view of the mechanisms used in transformers.</p> <p>In addition to these, transformers also use <em>positional encoding</em> to encode the position of the tokens in the input sequence. In the context of images, is encodes where each patch occurs in the image.</p> <p><img src="C:\Users\ITSloaner\AppData\Roaming\marktext\images\2024-04-10-18-07-17-image.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Positional encoding is usually done via sinusoidal functions. Other “learning-based” representations have been explored but they don’t have much different effect. This encoding structure allows extrapolation to sequnce lengths not seen in training.</p> <p>They also have <em>multi-head attention</em> which is equivalent to multiple channels in CNNs. That is, it allows patches to output more than one type of information.</p> <p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_multi-headed_self-attention-recap.png" alt=""/></p> <p>This <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">blog</a> explains these mechanisms in-depth for interested readers. In summary, the functions of the encoder is visualized as</p> <p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png" alt=""/></p> <h3 id="decoders">Decoders</h3> <p>A decoder block is similar to an encoder block, with auto-regressive . The attention values learned in Encoders are used as ‘keys’ in the decoder attention block. This is called as <em>cross attention</em>.</p> <h2 id="vision-transformers">Vision-Transformers</h2> <p>Vision transformers build on the same ideas used in a transformer. Typically, they use only the encoder part of the architecture where patches are extracted from images and are flattened to form the tokens for the attention mechanism. They are usually projected using a linear layer or a CNN before performing the calculations. Apart from this, vision transformers also include an additional <em>class token</em> in the embeddings to help learn the global information across the image.</p> <p>CNNs typically have better inductive bias whereas transformers excel in shorter learning paths for long-range reasoning. However, the cost of self-attention is quadratic in the image size. Also note that, if the patch-size is too large, then we might lose the information within the patches. This is a tradeoff, and the decision is made based on the task at hand. For example, classification may work with large patches but tasks such as segmentation may not.</p> <h3 id="swin-transformers-and-dense-prediction-transformers">Swin Transformers and Dense Prediction Transformers</h3> <p>The vanilla vision transformer is restricted to classification tasks and is not optimal for other tasks like detection and segmentation. Also, as we have noted before, the quadratic complexity limit the number of patches in the image. Some image processing pipelines extract features across different scales of an image whereas the vanilla transformer is restricted to the uniform (coarse) scale.</p> <p>To address these limitations, <strong>swin transformers</strong> bring two key ideas from CNNs</p> <ul> <li> <p>Multi-scale feature maps - Feature maps from one resolution are downsampled to match the size in the next block.</p> <p><img src="../../assets/imgs/2024-04-12-17-27-50-image.png" title="" alt="" data-align="left"/></p> </li> <li> <p>Local connectivity -</p> <ul> <li> <p>Windowed self-attention - Limit the computations by considering a local window (this was actually left as future work in the original attention paper).</p> </li> <li> <p>Shifted window self-attention - Allows windowed self-attention to learn long-range features using “shifts”. Essentially, we move the patches around to bring farther patches close together.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>However, these modifications are not enough for tasks like segmentation. Instead, we use something called as a <em>dense prediction transformer</em> (<strong>DPTs</strong>) where we couple the transformer encoder with a convolutional decoder to upsample and predict the required output.</p> <blockquote> <p>CNNs are shift-invariant whereas ViTs are permutation invariant. Why?</p> </blockquote> <p><img src="../../assets/imgs/2024-04-12-17-36-33-image.png" alt=""/></p> <p>At each scale level in the above picture, we <em>reassemble</em> the tokens by concatenating and convolving with appropriate kernels to recover image-like representations in the decoder layers.</p> <h3 id="multimodality">Multimodality</h3> <p>Transformers allowed for easy multi-modal representations by tokenizing data from each modality with its own variant of <em>patches</em>. Works such as VATT have explored merging audio waveforms, text and images.</p> <h1 id="generative-models">Generative Models</h1> <h2 id="discriminative-and-generative-models">Discriminative and Generative Models</h2> <p>Disciminative models (classifiers) learn a many-to-one function \(f\) to learn labels for a given input. A generative model \(g\) maps these labels to the input space, and this function is one-to-many since one label can map to multiple inputs. It is difficult to model a stochastic function. Therefore, a generator model is coupled with a <em>noise vector</em> to construct a deterministic \(g\) with stochastic input \(z\). This variable \(z\) is called a <strong>latent variable</strong> since it is not observed in training data composed of \(\{x, y\}\) pairs.</p> \[\begin{align*} \text{Discriminative Models learn } P(Y \vert X) \\ \text{Generative Models learn } P(X, Y) \\ \text{Conditional Generator learn } P(X \vert Y) \\ \end{align*}\] <p>Let us focus on image generative models. Then, each dimension of the latent variable can encode the various characteristics of the image essentially allowing us to generate a wide variety of images. The labels \(y\) for images need not be classification labels, but textual descriptions can also be used for supervision.</p> <p>To understand how these models work, consider the case of uncoditional generative models. The goal is, given the real data \(x\), to generate synthetic data \(\hat x\) that <em>looks like</em> the real data. How do we quantify ‘looks like’?</p> <ul> <li> <p>We can try and match some marginal statistics - mean, variance, edge statistics, etc of the real data. Such measures are very useful in techniques for texture synthesis. For example, <a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/labs/heegerlab/content/publications/Heeger-siggraph95.pdf">Heeger-Bergen texture synthesis [1995]</a> uses an iterative process starting from the Gaussian noise and matches intensity histograms across different scales.

During generation, return samples which have a high score. This paradigm is particularly useful for applications like anomaly detection.</p> <p>In these methods, we produce \(p_\theta\) fit to the training data by optimizing \(\arg\min_{p_\theta} D(p_{\theta}, p_{data})\). Since we don’t know \(p_{data}\) explicitly (we only have access to samples \(x \sim p_{data}\)), we minimize the <strong>KL-divergence</strong> to reduce the distance between the distributions using the samples.</p> \[\begin{align*} p_\theta^* &amp;= \arg\min_{p_\theta} KL(p_{data} \vert\vert p_\theta)\\ &amp;= \arg\max_{p_\theta} \mathbb E_{x\sim p_{data}}[\log p_\theta] - \mathbb E_{x\sim p_{data}}[\log p_{data}] \\ &amp;= \arg\max_{p_\theta} \mathbb E_{x\sim p_{data}}[\log p_\theta] \end{align*}\] <p>Intuitively, this way of optimization increases the density where the models are observed.</p> <p>The energy-based models have a slight modification wherein the energy function E_\theta is unnormalized unlike the probability density function p_\theta. Indeed, p_\theta can be determined as</p> \[\begin{align*} p_\theta &amp;= \frac{e^{-E_\theta}}{Z(\theta)}, \\ &amp;\text{ where } Z_\theta = \int_x e^{-E_{\theta}(x)} dx \end{align*}\] <p>This formulation is called as <em>Boltzmann or Gibbs</em> distibution. Learning energy function is convenient since normalization is intractable since we cannot see all the samples in the distribution.

How do we sample in these approaches? Sampling approaches <strong>Markov Chain Monte Carlo</strong> (MCMC) only require relative probabilities for generating data. We can also find data points that maximize the probability.</p> \[\nabla_x \log p_\theta(x) = -\nabla_x E_\theta(x)\] <p>On the other hand, where would be prefer probability formulation over energy? Certain systems like safety in autonomous driving require absolute quantifiable probabilities rather than relative scores.</p> <p>In probability modeling, the probability of space where no samples are observed is automatically pushed down due to normalization. However, in energy based models, we need an explicit negative term to push energy up where no data points are observed. To do so, we set up an iterative optimization where the gradient of the log-likelihood function naturally decomposes into contrastive terms</p> \[\begin{align*} \nabla_\theta \mathbb E_{x \sim p_{data}} [\log p_\theta(x)] &amp;= \frac{1}{N}\nabla_\theta\sum_{i = 1}^N (\underbrace{-E_\theta(x^{(i)})}_{\text{ data samples}} + \underbrace{E_\theta(\hat x^{(i)})}_{\text{model samples}}) \\ &amp;= - \mathbb E_{x \sim p_{data}} [\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\theta (x)] + \mathbb E_{x \sim p_\theta} [\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\theta(x)] \end{align*}\] <h4 id="sampling">Sampling</h4> <p>We randomly initialize \(\hat x_0\)$ at \(t = 0\).

It is hard to map pure noise to \(x \sim N(0, I)\) to structured data, but it is very easy to do the opposite. To readers familiar with autoregressive models, where we remove one pixel of information at a time, this is much more generalized.</p> <p>The forward process in these models involves adding noise to the image \(x_0\) over many time steps. At time \(t\), we add noise \(\epsilon_t\) to obtain \(x_{t + 1}\) from \(x_{t}\). The noise addition is modeled with respect to the following equation</p> \[x_t = \sqrt{(1 - \beta_t) x_{t - 1}} + \sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon_t, \quad \epsilon_t \sim N(0, I)\] <p>If this process is repeated for a large number of times, it can be shown that the final output simulates white noise. Now, in the learning part, we train a predictor to learn denoising from \(x_t\) to \(x_{t - 1}\). That is, given our model \(f_\theta\)</p> \[\hat x_{t - 1} = f_\theta(x_t , t)\] <h3 id="forward-noising">Forward Noising</h3> <p>Given an image \(x_0 \sim q(x)\), we essentially add the following Gaussian noise in \(T\) time steps</p> \[q(x_t \vert x_{t - 1}) = \mathcal N(x_t ; \sqrt{1 - \beta} x_{t - 1}, \beta_t I)\] <p>The term \(\beta_t\) is referred to as the schedule and \(0 &lt; \beta_t &lt; 1\). Typically, we set it to a small value in the beginning and do linear increments with time.

The approaches require global reasoning as well.</p> <p>A naive approch would be to classify a pixel by considering the patch around the pixel in the image. This is very expensive computationally and does not capture any global information.</p> <p>Another approach is to consider image resolution convolutions (purely convolutions with stride 1, no pooling) and maining the image resolution to produce the output. This still does not work quite well, and they also consume more memory.</p> <p>Taking classification networks as the motications, some networks try pooling/striding to downsample the features. This architecture corresponds to the encoder part of the model, and the decoder then upsamples the image using transposed convolution, interpolation, unpooling to recover the spatial details in the original size.

The design choice for the masking involved masking around 75% of the patches.

Also, NLP tasks can get away with a simple MLP for decoders but vision taks require strong decoders.</p> <p>The model allows for prompts using points, box or text. The decoder has self-attention on the primpts followed by cross-attention with image and MLP for non-linearity to get masks.

Given traffic participants and scene elements which are inter-dependent, we need to predict trajectories with scene awareness and multimodality. Humans are able to predict up to 10 seconds in highway scenes and plan their trajectory effectively whereas the SOTA models have a large gap in performance.</p> <p>More concretely, the algorithm takes a video sequence as an input, and needs to predict <strong>probabilistic</strong> trajectories which are diverse, have 3D awareness, capture semantics interactions and focus on <strong>long-term rewards</strong>. There are many components in these solutions including 3D localization module, generative sampling modules, semantic scene modules and scene aware fusion modules with encoders and decoders.</p> <p>#</p> <h3 id="representation-framework">Representation Framework</h3> <p>The past observed trajectories are represented by X = {X_{i, t - l + 1}, \dots, X_{i, t}} usng we which we wish to predict future trajectory Y_i = {Y_{i, t + 1}, \dots, Y_{i, t + \delta}}.

Following this, the refinement step calculates the displacement \Delta Y_t for the selected trajectory.</p> <p>Focusing on the sample generation module, the goal is to estimate posterior P(Y \vert X, I). Earlier, RNNs and other deterministic function maps from {X, I} to Y have been designed to address this. The problem with training in this approach is that the ground truth has a single future trajectory whereas the sampler predicts a distribution. How do we compare the two?</p> <h2 id="principal-component-analysis">Principal Component Analysis</h2> <p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique where data is linearly transformed onto a new coordinate system such that the directions (principal components) capturing the largest variation in the data can be easily identified. PCA works well when the data is near a <strong>linear manifold</strong>* in high dimensional spaces.</p> <p>CAn we approximate PCA with a Network? Train a network with a bottleneck hidden layer, and try to make the output the same as the input.

The model’s efficiency is higher for lower dimensional data and requires more work for scaling to higher dimensions.</p> <h1 id="structure-from-motion">Structure from Motion</h1> <p>The problem statement for structure from motion is - given a set of unordered or ordered set of images, estimate the relative positions of the cameras and recover the 3D structure of the world, typically as point clouds. In scenarios like autonomous driving, the images are ordered and the emphasis is on real-time performance.</p> <h2 id="feature-detection">Feature Detection</h2> <p>The first step involves identifying matching features across images to determine the camera movements. In unordered feature matching, the images to be compared are identified using vocabulary based retrieval methods to reduce the complexity from $\mathcal O(n^2)$ to $\log$ complexity.</p> <p>In the canonical coordinate system, the camera axis passes through the origin, and the $k$-axis points away from the camera. The $i$-axis and $j$-axis are parallel to the image plane. The projection of 3D points in the pixel space involves a non-linear operation -</p> \[(x, y, z) \to (-d\frac{x}{z}, -d\frac{y}{z})\] <p>where $d$ is the distance of the camera plane from the origin. For computational reasons, we want to convert these to a linear transformation. This is done via homogenous point representations -</p> \[\underbrace{(\frac{x}{w}, \frac{y}{w})}_\text{Euclidean} \to\underbrace{(x, y, w)}_\text{Homogenous}\] <p>Such representations are useful for ray marching operations. The camera transformation then becomes</p> \[\begin{bmatrix}-d &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -d &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z \\ 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-dx \\ -dy \\ z\end{bmatrix}\] <p>which represents $(-d\frac{x}{z}, -d\frac{y}{z})$ in Euclidean space. The matrix above can be decomposed as</p> \[\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}-d &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -d &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}}_{K}\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}}_\text{projection}\] <p>Here, we have considered a simple model for the camera intrinsics matrix $K$ whose general form is</p> \[\begin{bmatrix}-d_x &amp; s &amp; c_x \\ 0 &amp; -d_y &amp; c_y \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\] <p>where $\alpha = \frac{d_x}{d_y}$ is the aspect ratio (1 unless pixels are not square), $s$ is the skew, $c_x, c_y$ represent the translation of the camera origin wrt world origin.</p> <h3 id="coordinate-systems">Coordinate Systems</h3> <p>We need to determine the transformations between the world and camera coordinate systems. Since camera is a rigid body, the transformation is represented by a translation and a rotation. Considering these, the projection matrix becomes</p> \[\Pi = K \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}R &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} T &amp; - c \\ 0 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\] <h2 id="problem-formulation-1">Problem Formulation</h2> <p>Given the projections $\Pi_i X_i \sim P_{ii}$, we aim to minimize a non-linear least squares of the form $G(R, T, X)$ -</p> \[G(X, R, T) = \sum_{i = 1}^m \sum_{j = 1}^n w_{ij} \cdot \left\|P(X_i, R_j, t_j) - \begin{bmatrix}u_{i, j} \\v_{i, j}\end{bmatrix} \right\|^2\] <p>This problem is called as <strong>Bundle Adjustment</strong>. Since this is an non-linear least squares, Levenberg-Marquardt is a popular choice to solve this. In theory, given enough number of points, we should get a unique solution. However, practically, we require a very good initialization to navigate the high-dimensional space. Also, outliers in the feature detection can deteriorate the performance of the model drastically.</p> <h2 id="tricks-for-real-world-performance">Tricks for Real-world performance</h2> <p>Basically, we aim to make the feature detection very robust to remove all the possible outliers. Towards that, we note the following background</p> <h4 id="fundamental-matrix">Fundamental Matrix</h4> <p>Given pixel coordinates $x_1, x_2$ of a point $x$ in two camera views, we define a fundamental matrix $F$ such that $x_1Fx_2 = 0$. The fundamental matrix is unique to the cameras and their relative configuration. It is given by</p> \[\begin{align*} F &amp;= K_2^{-T} E K_1^{-1} \\ E &amp;= [t]_{\times} R \end{align*}\] <p>where $R$ and $[t]_\times$represent the relative base transformations given by</p> \[[t]_X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -t_z &amp; t_y \\ t_z &amp; 0 &amp; -t_x \\ -t_y &amp; t_x &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\] <p>The matrix $E$ is called as the essential matrix which has similar properties as the fundamental matrix and is also independent of the camera parameters.</p> <p>The fundamental matrix is scale-invariant and has rank $2$. Therefore, it has $7$ degrees of freedom implying that we just need $8$ correctly configured points ($x$ and $y$) across the two pixel spaces to compute the fundamental matrix. We pose this problem as solving $Af = 0$ - minimizing $|Af|$ using SVD (to directly operate on the rank). This procedure is popularly known as the $8$-point algorithm. Furthermore, we can also use this to find the camera parameters by using more points.</p> <p>The essential matrix can be derived from $F$ using $RQ$ decomposition to obtain skew-symmetric and orthogonal matrices $[t]_\times$ and $R$. These matrices are what we were looking to determine - the relative configuration of the cameras with respect to each other. Now, triangulation can be used to locate $x$ in the 3D space. However, this may not work since the projection lines may not intersect in 3D space.</p> <p>To filter outliers, we will use the fundamental matrix as a model - it is a geometric property which all points have to abide by. However, the fundamental matrix itself is constructed from the detected features, which can be noisy. We need to design a robust method using heuristics to filter the outliers. We use a population-voting metric to choose the best model.</p> <h3 id="ransac">RANSAC</h3> <p>Suppose we are finding the best-fit line for a given set of points. For every pair of points, we determine the corresponding line and count the number of outliers for that particular line. The best model would then be the on which has the minimum number of outliers. This idea can be extended to any model, and it can be used to calculate the best fundamental matrix. The algorithm is as follows -</p> <ol> <li>Randomly choose $s$ samples - typically $s$ is the minimum sample size to git a model (7 for a Fundamental matrix)</li> <li>Fit a model to these samples</li> <li>Count the number of inliers that approximately fit the models.</li> <li>Repeat $N$ times</li> <li>Choose the model with the largest set of inliers.</li> </ol> <p>How do we choose $N$? It depends on the ratio of outliers to the dataset size, the minimum number of samples $s$ for the model and confidence score. We get \(N = \frac{\log(1 - p)}{\log(1 - (1 - \epsilon)^s)}\)</p> <p>Where $\epsilon$ is the proportion of outliers and $p$ is the confidence score.</p> <h3 id="bundle-adjustment">Bundle Adjustment</h3> <p>Assuming we have a good $R, t$ robust to outliers with the above methods, we can now solve the least-squares problem to determine the scene geometry.</p> <h2 id="minimal-problems-in-computer-vision">Minimal Problems in computer Vision</h2> <insert image=""> ### Three—point absolute pose estimation Assume the intrinsics of the camera are known.

The field has deep and attractive scientific problems, which have been advancing at a rapid pace in the past few years. In the early days of research, the focus in vision was on engineering “good” features coupled with a optimisation algorithm or a shallow neural network. As the processors became more powerful, the emphasis shifted to end-to-end approaches with inclusion of self-supervision and multi-modal learning paradigms. It is often helpful to breakdown the perception tasks into known-algorithms. For example, in autonomous driving, the tasks include SLAM (visual, Structure from Motion), path planning (lane detection, obstacle detection, 3D localization), Semantic segmentation etc. Similarly, the tasks in augmented reality devices are gaze tracking, material and lighting estimation, head pose estimation, depth estimation, etc. Deep learning has opened new areas of research in vision. Features such as generation of high-quality content, end-to-end training, data-driven priors and highly parallelizable architectures have proven advantageous for many problems in computer vision. However, it is also important to note the limitations of these techniques - Large scale labeled data is not always available Lack of generalization to unseen domains Good at narrow “classification”, not at broad “reasoning” Lack of interpretability Lack of reliability, security or privacy guarantee To counter these problems, we typically couple our algorithms with self-supervision, physical modelling, multi-modal learning and foundation models. In the recent years, these techniques have been applied to various problems, and the following are arguably the biggest advances in Computer Vision - Vision Transformers Vision-Language Models Diffusion Models Neural Rendering These techniques show promise to solve keystone problems in augmented reality, interactive robotics, and autonomous driving. The course will cover the following these topics, along with other fundamentals required. Demonstrate code in presentation Neural Architectures The motivation for an artificial neuron (perceptron), comes from a biological neuron where the output is linear combination of the inputs combined with a non-linear activation function. From here, we develop multi-layer networks which are again motivated from the Hubel and Weisel’s architecture in biological cells. Neural Networks The simplest neural network is a perceptron represented by \(\sigma (x) = \text{sign}(\sum_i w_i x_i + b)\) where the optimal weight values are obtained using an unconstrained optimization problem. These concepts can be extended for “Linear Regression” and “Logistic Regression” tasks. Non-linearity in neural networks is introduced through Activation functions such as Sigmoid - Have vanishing gradient issues tanh - Centered version of sigmoid ReLU - Simplest non-linear activation, with easy gradient calculation. ELU - Added to prevent passive neurons. At the output layer, we apply a final non-linear function is applied to calculate the loss in the predicted output. Typically for classification problems, Softmax function is used to map the network outputs to probabilities. One-hot representations are not differentiable, and are hence not used for this task. In image synthesis problems, the output layer usually has \(255*sigmoid(z)\). Theorem (Universal function approximators): A two-layer network with a sufficient number of neurons can approximate any continous function to any desired accuracy. Width or Depth? A wider network needs more and more neurons to represent arbitrary function with high enough precision. A deeper network on the contrary, require few parameters needed to achieve a similar approximation power. However, “overly deep” plain nets do not perform well. This is due to the vanishing gradient problem, wherein we are not able to train deep networks with the typical optimization algorithms. Convolution Networks The neural network architecture is modified for images using “learnable kernels” in convolutional neural networks. Each convolution layer consists of a set of kernels that produce feature maps from the input. These feature maps capture the spatial and local relationships in the input which is crucial for images. The induction bias in images is that neighbouring variables are locally correlated. An image need not be 2D, it can consist of multiple channels (RGB, hyperspectral, etc.), and convolutional layers work across all these channels to produce feature maps. In a classical neural network, each pixel in the input image would be connected to every neuron in the network layer leading to many parameters for a single image. Using kernels, we use shared weights across all pixel locations, and this greatly reduces the number of learnable parameters without losing much information. Convolution layers are generally accompanies with Pooling layers which do not have any learnable parameters, and are used to reduce the size of the output. These layers are invariant to small (spatial)transformations in the input and help observe a larger receptive field in the next layer. The latter property is important to observe hidden layers in the feature maps. Receptive Field - It is the area in the input iamge “seen” by a unit in a CNN. Inits with deeper layers will have wider receptive fields whereas wider receptive fields allow more global reasoning across entire image. This way, the pooling leads to more rapid widening of receptive fields. We need \(\mathcal O(n/k)\) layers with \((k \times k)\) convolutional filters to have a receptive field of \(n\) in the input. Dilation layers are used to achieve the same receptive field with \(\mathcal O(\log n)\) layers. However, in practice, the empirical receptive fields in the deeper networks is lower than the theoretical value due to sparse weights. Convolution networks are augmented with dense layers to get the output, to learn from the feature maps. The vanishing gradient problem in deeper networks has been solved using skip connections wherein the features from the earlier layers are concatenated with the deeper ones to allow passage of information. This way, we provide the network with the original input allowing it to learn the smaller fluctuations in the input (rather than focusing on learning the input itself). In summary, the key operations in convolutional layers are Input image -&gt; Convlution -&gt; Non-linearity -&gt; Spatial Pooling -&gt; Feature Maps CNNs have the above set of operations repeated many times. CNNs have been successful due to the following reasons Good Abstractions - Hierarchical and expressive feature representations. Conventional image processing algorithms relied on a pyramidal representation of features, and this methodology has also paved its way in CNNs. Good inductive biases - Remarkable in transferring knowledge across tasks. That is, pretrained networks can be easily augmented with other general tasks. Ease of implementation - Can be trained end-to-end, rather than hand-crafted for each task, and they can easily be implemented on parallel architectures. The key ideas - Convolutional layers leverage the local connectivity and weight sharing to reduce the number of learnable parameters. Pooling layers allow larger receptive fields letting us capture global features. Smaller kernels limit the number of parameters without compromising the performance much. This design decision comes from preferring deeper networks over wider networks. For example, \((1 \times 1)\) kernels are reduce the dimension in the channels dimension. Skip connections allow easier optimization with greater depth. Why are (1, 1) kernels useful? Use fewer channels instead? Transformers Transformers have shown better results in almost every task that CNNs have shone previously in. CNNs require significant depth or larger kernels to share information between non-local spatial locations (recall receptive fields). Many tasks, such as question-answering, require long-range reasoning and transformers are very good at this. For example, placing objects in augmented reality requires reasoning about light-sources, surface estimation, occlusion/shadow detection, etc. This is the primary intuition behind attention mechanism which is representative of foveated vision in humans. Tokens - A data type than can be understood as a set of neurons obtained from vectorizing patches of an image. Typically need not be vectors, but they can be any structured froup that alows a set of differentiable operations. Note that these tokens in hidden layers might not correspond to pixels or interpretable attributes. The following captures a very good intuition for transformers. A transformers acts on tokens similarly as neural network acts on neurons. That is, combining tokens is same as for neurons, except tokens are vectors \(t_{out }= \sum_i w_i t_i\). In neural networks, linear layers are represented by \(x_{out} = W x_{in}\) and \(W\) is data-free, whereas in transformers, \(T_{out} = AT_{in}\), \(A\) depends on the data (attention). Again, non-linearity in neural networks is implemented via functions like ReLU whereas transformers use dense layers for non-linearity (applied token wise). The attention layer is a spsecial kind of linear transformation of tokens, wherein the attention function \(A = f(.)\) tells how much importance to pay to each token depending on the input query and other signals. Attention-maps help us visualize the global dependencies in the information. The required information is embedded in some dimension of the token representation. For example, the first dimension can count the number of horses in an iamge, and the bottom 3 dimensions can encode the color of the horse on the right. Attention has this flexibility to different allocations address different parts of a query. They can “attend” to only certain patches which are important to the query. This kind of functionality is difficult with CNNs. Apply embedding and neural network (before CNNs and Transofrmers)? Same number of parameters? Essentially similar thing? Associated higher weight to more related embedding. Query-Key-Value Attention The mechanisms described previously are implemented by projecting tokens into queries, keys and values. Each of these are a vector of dimensions $p$, where $p &lt; d$. The query vector for the question is used to weigh the key vector for each token to obtain the values. This is done via computing the similarity between query and each key, and then the attention is given by the extent of similarities, normalized with softmax. The output token is obtained by summing all value vectors with weights assigned from the previous calculations. Roughly, the process looks like - \[\begin{align*} \left. \begin{align*} q=W_q t \\ K_i=W_k t_i \end{align*} \right\} \implies s_i=q^T k_i \\ a_i=softmax(s_i) \\ t_{out} = \sum a_i v_i \end{align*}\] The purpose of “values” is to ‘project’ back the similarities between queries and keys to the ‘token space’. Also note that, if the patch-size is too large, then we might lose the information within the patches. This is a tradeoff, and the decision is made based on the task at hand. For example, classification may work with large patches but tasks such as segmentation may not. Self-Attention How do we learn implicit representations that can work with general queries? We compute self-attention using the image tokens as the queries - information derived from the image itself. How does this process help us? For example, if we are performing instance segmentation of an image with horses. Then, the concept of ‘horse’ is learned by attending more to tother horse tokens and less to background. Similarly, ‘a particular instance’ is learned by attending less to the tokens from other horses. When we do this for all pairs across \(N\) tokens gives us an \(N \times N\) attention matrix. Typically, this matrix is computed in the encoder part of a transformer. This matrix is then used in the decoder with an input query to obtain the required results. Encoders An encoder of a transformer typically consists of many identical blocks connected serially with one another. Each such encoder block, computes a self-attention matrix and passes it through a feed-forward neural network, and they need to be applied across all the tokens in the input. Since the embeddings of tokens are independent of one another, each level of encoder blocks can be applied in parallel to all the tokens (patches in vision transformers) to obtain the embeddings. Such parallel computations were not possible in previous models like RNNs, which heavily relied on sequential dependencies. The original transformers paper normalizes the similarities with \(\sqrt{N}\) where \(N\) is the embedding dimension. This allows the gradients to stabilise and gives much better performance. This a simplified view of the mechanisms used in transformers. In addition to these, transformers also use positional encoding to encode the position of the tokens in the input sequence. In the context of images, is encodes where each patch occurs in the image. Positional encoding is usually done via sinusoidal functions. Other “learning-based” representations have been explored but they don’t have much different effect. This encoding structure allows extrapolation to sequnce lengths not seen in training. They also have multi-head attention which is equivalent to multiple channels in CNNs. That is, it allows patches to output more than one type of information. This blog explains these mechanisms in-depth for interested readers. In summary, the functions of the encoder is visualized as Decoders A decoder block is similar to an encoder block, with auto-regressive . The attention values learned in Encoders are used as ‘keys’ in the decoder attention block. This is called as cross attention. Vision-Transformers Vision transformers build on the same ideas used in a transformer. Typically, they use only the encoder part of the architecture where patches are extracted from images and are flattened to form the tokens for the attention mechanism. They are usually projected using a linear layer or a CNN before performing the calculations. Apart from this, vision transformers also include an additional class token in the embeddings to help learn the global information across the image. CNNs typically have better inductive bias whereas transformers excel in shorter learning paths for long-range reasoning. However, the cost of self-attention is quadratic in the image size. Also note that, if the patch-size is too large, then we might lose the information within the patches. This is a tradeoff, and the decision is made based on the task at hand. For example, classification may work with large patches but tasks such as segmentation may not. Swin Transformers and Dense Prediction Transformers The vanilla vision transformer is restricted to classification tasks and is not optimal for other tasks like detection and segmentation. Also, as we have noted before, the quadratic complexity limit the number of patches in the image. Some image processing pipelines extract features across different scales of an image whereas the vanilla transformer is restricted to the uniform (coarse) scale. To address these limitations, swin transformers bring two key ideas from CNNs Multi-scale feature maps - Feature maps from one resolution are downsampled to match the size in the next block. Local connectivity - Windowed self-attention - Limit the computations by considering a local window (this was actually left as future work in the original attention paper). Shifted window self-attention - Allows windowed self-attention to learn long-range features using “shifts”. Essentially, we move the patches around to bring farther patches close together. However, these modifications are not enough for tasks like segmentation. Instead, we use something called as a dense prediction transformer (DPTs) where we couple the transformer encoder with a convolutional decoder to upsample and predict the required output. CNNs are shift-invariant whereas ViTs are permutation invariant. Why? At each scale level in the above picture, we reassemble the tokens by concatenating and convolving with appropriate kernels to recover image-like representations in the decoder layers. Multimodality Transformers allowed for easy multi-modal representations by tokenizing data from each modality with its own variant of patches. Works such as VATT have explored merging audio waveforms, text and images. Generative Models Discriminative and Generative Models Disciminative models (classifiers) learn a many-to-one function \(f\) to learn labels for a given input. A generative model \(g\) maps these labels to the input space, and this function is one-to-many since one label can map to multiple inputs. It is difficult to model a stochastic function. Therefore, a generator model is coupled with a noise vector to construct a deterministic \(g\) with stochastic input \(z\). This variable \(z\) is called a latent variable since it is not observed in training data composed of \(\{x, y\}\) pairs. \[\begin{align*} \text{Discriminative Models learn } P(Y \vert X) \\ \text{Generative Models learn } P(X, Y) \\ \text{Conditional Generator learn } P(X \vert Y) \\ \end{align*}\] Let us focus on image generative models. Then, each dimension of the latent variable can encode the various characteristics of the image essentially allowing us to generate a wide variety of images. The labels \(y\) for images need not be classification labels, but textual descriptions can also be used for supervision. To understand how these models work, consider the case of uncoditional generative models. The goal is, given the real data \(x\), to generate synthetic data \(\hat x\) that looks like the real data. How do we quantify ‘looks like’? We can try and match some marginal statistics - mean, variance, edge statistics, etc of the real data. Such measures are very useful in techniques for texture synthesis. For example, Heeger-Bergen texture synthesis [1995] uses an iterative process starting from the Gaussian noise and matches intensity histograms across different scales. Such design choices are used in modern techniques like StyleGANs and Diffusion models. Have a high probability of success under a model fit to real-data (A discriminator). The key-challenge in these models is novelity in the generation to ensure generalization. Generative models are classified into the following approaches - Energy-based models - Learn a scoring function \(s:X \to R\) that scores real-samples with a high score which represents energy/probability. During generation, return samples which have a high score. This paradigm is particularly useful for applications like anomaly detection. Sampling from Noise - Learn a generative function \(g: Z \to X\) without needing to learn a probability density function. These methods explicitly model the data distribution, and techniques like GANs and Diffusion Models come under this regime. Density/Energy based models Learn a scoring function \(s:X \to R\) that scores real-samples with a high score which represents energy/probability. During generation, return samples which have a high score. This paradigm is particularly useful for applications like anomaly detection. In these methods, we produce \(p_\theta\) fit to the training data by optimizing \(\arg\min_{p_\theta} D(p_{\theta}, p_{data})\). Since we don’t know \(p_{data}\) explicitly (we only have access to samples \(x \sim p_{data}\)), we minimize the KL-divergence to reduce the distance between the distributions using the samples. \[\begin{align*} p_\theta^* &amp;= \arg\min_{p_\theta} KL(p_{data} \vert\vert p_\theta)\\ &amp;= \arg\max_{p_\theta} \mathbb E_{x\sim p_{data}}[\log p_\theta] - \mathbb E_{x\sim p_{data}}[\log p_{data}] \\ &amp;= \arg\max_{p_\theta} \mathbb E_{x\sim p_{data}}[\log p_\theta] \end{align*}\] Intuitively, this way of optimization increases the density where the models are observed. The energy-based models have a slight modification wherein the energy function E_\theta is unnormalized unlike the probability density function p_\theta. Indeed, p_\theta can be determined as \[\begin{align*} p_\theta &amp;= \frac{e^{-E_\theta}}{Z(\theta)}, \\ &amp;\text{ where } Z_\theta = \int_x e^{-E_{\theta}(x)} dx \end{align*}\] This formulation is called as Boltzmann or Gibbs distibution. Learning energy function is convenient since normalization is intractable since we cannot see all the samples in the distribution. What is the motivation to use exponential functions? It arises naturally in physical statistics Many common distributions (Normal, Poisson, …) are modeled using exponential functions. Want to handle large variations in probability Although we don’t have the probabilities, we can still compare different samples using ratios of their energies. How do we sample in these approaches? Sampling approaches Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) only require relative probabilities for generating data. We can also find data points that maximize the probability. \[\nabla_x \log p_\theta(x) = -\nabla_x E_\theta(x)\] On the other hand, where would be prefer probability formulation over energy? Certain systems like safety in autonomous driving require absolute quantifiable probabilities rather than relative scores. In probability modeling, the probability of space where no samples are observed is automatically pushed down due to normalization. However, in energy based models, we need an explicit negative term to push energy up where no data points are observed. To do so, we set up an iterative optimization where the gradient of the log-likelihood function naturally decomposes into contrastive terms \[\begin{align*} \nabla_\theta \mathbb E_{x \sim p_{data}} [\log p_\theta(x)] &amp;= \frac{1}{N}\nabla_\theta\sum_{i = 1}^N (\underbrace{-E_\theta(x^{(i)})}_{\text{ data samples}} + \underbrace{E_\theta(\hat x^{(i)})}_{\text{model samples}}) \\ &amp;= - \mathbb E_{x \sim p_{data}} [\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\theta (x)] + \mathbb E_{x \sim p_\theta} [\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\theta(x)] \end{align*}\] Sampling We randomly initialize \(\hat x_0\)$ at \(t = 0\). Then, we repeat the following Let \(\hat x' = \hat x_t + \eta\)$ where \(\eta\) is some noise If \(\mathbb E_\theta(\hat x') &lt; \mathbb E_\theta(\hat x_t)\), then choose \(\hat x_{t + 1} = \hat x'\). Else choose \(\hat x_{t + 1} = \hat x'\) with probability \(e^{(\mathbb E_\theta(\hat x_t) - \mathbb E_\theta(\hat x'))}\) In practice, this algorithm takes a long time to converge. A variant of this called Langevin MCMC uses the gradient of the distribution to accelerate the sampling procedure Choose \(q(x)\) an easy to sample prior distribution. Repeat for a fixed number of iterations \(t\) \[\hat x_{t + 1} \sim \hat x_t + \epsilon \nabla_x \log p_\theta(\hat x_t) - \sqrt{2\epsilon} z_t\] where \(z_t \sim \mathcal N(0, I)\). When \(\epsilon \to 0\), and \(t \to \infty\), we have \(\hat x_t \sim p_\theta\) Diffusion Models The inuition for these models builds from our previous approach. It is hard to map pure noise to \(x \sim N(0, I)\) to structured data, but it is very easy to do the opposite. To readers familiar with autoregressive models, where we remove one pixel of information at a time, this is much more generalized. The forward process in these models involves adding noise to the image \(x_0\) over many time steps. At time \(t\), we add noise \(\epsilon_t\) to obtain \(x_{t + 1}\) from \(x_{t}\). The noise addition is modeled with respect to the following equation \[x_t = \sqrt{(1 - \beta_t) x_{t - 1}} + \sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon_t, \quad \epsilon_t \sim N(0, I)\] If this process is repeated for a large number of times, it can be shown that the final output simulates white noise. Now, in the learning part, we train a predictor to learn denoising from \(x_t\) to \(x_{t - 1}\). That is, given our model \(f_\theta\) \[\hat x_{t - 1} = f_\theta(x_t , t)\] Forward Noising Given an image \(x_0 \sim q(x)\), we essentially add the following Gaussian noise in \(T\) time steps \[q(x_t \vert x_{t - 1}) = \mathcal N(x_t ; \sqrt{1 - \beta} x_{t - 1}, \beta_t I)\] The term \(\beta_t\) is referred to as the schedule and \(0 &lt; \beta_t &lt; 1\). Typically, we set it to a small value in the beginning and do linear increments with time. The above process is a Markov’s process, resulting in the following property \[q(x_{1:T} \vert x_0) = \prod_{t = 1}^T q(x_t \vert x_{t - 1})\] Instead of a slow step-by-step process, training uses samples from arbitrary time step. To decrease the computations, we use the following properties of Gaussian distributions Reparameterization trick: \(\mathcal N(\mu, \sigma^2)= \mu + \sigma \epsilon\) where \(\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0, I)\) Merging Gaussians \(\mathcal N(0, \sigma_1^2 I)\) and \(\mathcal N(0, \sigma_2^2 I)\) is a Gaussian of the form\(\mathcal N(0, (\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2) I)\) Define \(\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t\), and \(\bar \alpha_t = \prod_{i = 1}^t \alpha_i\), we can now sample \(x_t\) at an arbitrary time step \[\begin{align*} x_t &amp;= \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_{t - 1} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t}\epsilon_{t - 1} \\ &amp;= \sqrt{\alpha_t\alpha_{t - 1}} x_{t - 1} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t\alpha_{t - 1}}\epsilon_{t - 1} \\ &amp;\dots \\ &amp;= \sqrt{\bar \alpha_t}x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar \alpha_t}\epsilon \end{align*}\] When we schedule \(\beta_t\) such that \(\beta_1 &lt; \beta_2 &lt; \dots, \beta_T\) so that \(\bar \alpha_1 &gt; \dots, &gt; \bar \alpha_T\), such that \(\bar \alpha_T \to 0\), then \[q(x_T \vert x_0) \approx \mathcal N(x_T; 0, I)\] The intuition is that the diffusion kernel is a Gaussian \[q(x_t) = \int q(x_0, x_t) dx_0=\int q(x_0) q(x_t \vert x_0) dx_0\] There are theoretical bounds showing a relation between the number of steps and overfitting of the model to the distribution. There are no such guarantees for VAEs. The increasing \(\beta_t\) schedule sort of accelerates the diffusion process wherein we simulate white noise with few iterations. However, the stable diffusion paper to generate images chose the cosine learning schedule which gave better results. Reverse Denoising The goal is to start with noise and gradually denoise to generate images. We start with \(x_T \sim \mathcal N(0, I)\) and sample form \(q(x_{t - 1} \vert x_t)\) to denoise. When \(\beta_t\) is small enough, we can show that this quantity is a Gaussian. However, estimating the quantity is difficult since it requires optimization over the whole dataset. Therefore, we learn a model \(p_\theta\) to reverse the process \[P_\theta(x_{t - 1} \vert x_t) = \mathcal N(x_{t - 1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma\] # Essentially, the training objective is to maximise log-likelihood over the data distribution. A variational lower bound can be derived and is used in practice \[\mathbb E_{q(x_0)}[-\log p_\theta(X_0)] \leq \mathbb E_{q(x_0) q(x_{1:T}\vert x_0)} \left[-\log \frac{p_\theta (x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T} \vert x_0)}\right]\] Then, this decomposes into \[\sum_{t &gt; 1} D_{KL} (q(x_{t - 1} \vert x_t, x_0) \vert\vert p_\theta(x_{t - 1} \vert x_t)) + \text{other terms}\] The idea is that $q(x_{t - 1} \vert x_t, x_0)$ is tractable even though $q(x_{t - 1} \vert x_t)$ is not. That is because \[\begin{align*} q(x_{t - 1} \vert x_t, x_0) &amp;= \mathcal N(x_{t - 1}; \tilde \mu_t(x_t, x_0), \tilde \beta_t I) \\ \text{where } \tilde \mu_t(x_t, x_0) &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\bar \alpha_{t - 1}}}{1 - \bar \alpha_t}x_0 + \frac{\sqrt{1 - \beta_t} ( 1- \bar\alpha_{t - 1})}{1- \bar\alpha_{t - 1}}x_t \\ &amp;=\tilde \beta_t = \frac{1 - \bar \alpha_{t - 1}}{1 - \bar \alpha_t} \beta_t \end{align*}\] Sampling from Noise Generative Adversarial networks mainly fall in this domain. In these architectures, a generator network tries to fool the discriminator by generating real-looking images. In contrast, a discriminator network tries to distribguish between real and fake images. GANs don’t produce as good images as diffusion models, but the concept of adversarial learning is a crucial concept in many fields. The framework looks like this - The objective function for a GAN is formulated as a mini-max game - the generator tries to maximize the loss function whereas the discriminator tries to reduce it. \[L = \min_{\theta_g} \max_{\theta_d} [\mathbb E _{x \sim p_{data}} \log D_{\theta_d} (x) + \mathbb E_{z \sim p(z)} \log (1 - D(G_{\theta_g}(z)))]\] The training is done alternately, performing gradient ascent on the generator and descent on the discriminator. Object Detection Simply put, the goal is identify objects in a given image. The evolution of algorithms for object detection is summarized as HoG + SVM - Sliding window mechanism for feature detection. Deformable Part Models - CNN - Using a sliding window mechanism is computationally expensive. Instead, these methods use region proposals and filter out the ones with satisfying criteria. Transformers Self-supervision Open vocabulary Multi-stage CNNs RCNN The first demonstration that showed classification features from CNNs can be used to detect objects. Essentially, the last layer of the ImageNet classifier network was removed . Each region proposal is warped/cropped to match the CNN input size. The post-processing involves bounding box regression FastRCNN FasterRCNN Uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) after the last convolutional layer. The RPN is trained to produce region proposals directly without any need for external region proposals. After RPN, the RoI Pooling and an upstream classifier are used as regressors similar to FastRCNN. Region Proposal Network The network does the following - Slide a small window on the feature map A small network to do classification - object or no-object A regressor to give the bounding box Anchors Anchors are a set of reference positions on the feature map 3 dimensions with aspect ratio, 3 different scales of boxes, Training Non-Maximal Supression Since, multiple anchor boxes can map to an object, we iteratively choose the highest scoring box among the predictions and supp ress the predictions that have high IoU with the currently chosen box. Transformer based Architectures DETR Faster R-CNN has many steps, handcrafted architecture and potentially non-differentiable steps. In contrast, DETR was proposed - an end-to-end transformer based architecture for object detection. The motivation was to capture all the human-designed optimization parts of the pipeline into one black-box using a transformer. Why do we want such an end-to-end architecture? They are more flexible to diverse data, capturing large datasets, finetuning, etc. In this architecture, a CNN backbone like ResNet extracts the features which are passed through the encoder to obtain latent representations. These are then used with a decoder along with object queries in the form of cross-attention to give bounding boxes as the output. After obtaining the bounding boxes, the loss is appropriately calculated by matching the boxes to the correct labels. It is our task to assign a ground truth label to the predictions Hungarian?? The decoder takes object queries as input, 500 epochs encoder is segmented, decoder is just getting bounding boxes DINO lagging in scale variant objects. contrastive loss acting for negative samples YOLOX Single Shot-Detectors The motivation for these networks is to infer detections faster without much tradeoff in accuracy. Anchor boxes no ambiguous IoU Hard negative mining You Only Look Once (YOLO) Divide into grids anchor boxes in grid and class probability map YOLO-X No anchored mechanism - hyperparameter tuning, more predictions, less generalization (OOD fails) Detection head decoupling, no anchor boxes, SimOTA predict size and centers rather than top-left mosaicing and mixing Pyramid Feature Extractions RFCN Semantic Segmentation The goal in this task is much more fine-tuned wherein we assign class pixel-wise. We want locally accurate boundaries as compared to finding bounding boxes in object detection. The approaches require global reasoning as well. A naive approch would be to classify a pixel by considering the patch around the pixel in the image. This is very expensive computationally and does not capture any global information. Another approach is to consider image resolution convolutions (purely convolutions with stride 1, no pooling) and maining the image resolution to produce the output. This still does not work quite well, and they also consume more memory. Taking classification networks as the motications, some networks try pooling/striding to downsample the features. This architecture corresponds to the encoder part of the model, and the decoder then upsamples the image using transposed convolution, interpolation, unpooling to recover the spatial details in the original size. The convolutions can go deeper without occupying a lot of memory. How do we upsample? Transposed convolution to upsample. The operation is shown below - ![Transpose Convolution for Up-Sampling Images Paperspace Blog](https://blog.paperspace.com/content/images/2020/07/conv.gif) However, the outputs are not very precise. Combine global and local information. U-Net Unpooling followed by convolutions (simpler implementation of transposed convolution) The max-unpooling operation does the following - Why is this better? Lesser memory In all the architectures above, once you downsample the image, you lose a lot of spatial information and the network uses a significant amount of parameters learning the upsampling process to represent the final output. To help with this, we can do the following Predict at multiple scales and combine the predictions Dilated convolutions - These are used to increase the receptive field without downsampling the image too much - It’s multi-scale and also captures full-scale resolution. The idea of dilated convolution is very important in other tasks as well - It prevents the loss of spatial information in downsampling tasks. However, there are gridding artifacts and higher memory consumptions with Dilated networks. Degridding solutions Add convolution layers at end of the network with progressively lower dilation Remove skip connections in new layers, can propogate gridding artefacts because skip connections transfer high-frequency information. Skip-connections Physiological Grouping for Perception DeepLab v3+ Segformer Instance Segmentation Mask RCNN Predict eh Panoptic Segmentation Panoptic segmentation extends the idea of instance segmentation even further to segment objects beyond a fixed set of classes. # Universal Segmentation Specialized architectures for semantic MaskFormer The architecture contains a strong CNN backbone for the encoder along with a query and pixel decoder. The query decoder essentially takes $n$ inputs to generate $n$ masks. The outputs from these layers are passed through an MLP to get binary masks for different classes. Masked2Former Uses a masked attention layer instead of cross-attention to provide faster convergence Limitations Needs to be trained on speicfic datasets, struggles with small objects and large inference time. Hasn’t been extended to video segmentation and panoptic segmentation. Mask DINO Does both detection and segmentation. A Mask prediction branch along with box prediction in DINO. Unified Denoising Training Foundation Models Models that have been trained on simple tasks which have good performance in the pipelines of other tasks for zero-shot transfer capabilities. Such models were first used in Natural Language Processing and using these in vision is typicalled hindered by unavailability of labeled data. Segment Anything A model developed by Meta with zero-shot segmentation capabilities. The task this model tries to solve is to allow for interactive and automatic use with zero-shot generatlization and re-use. The model allows for flexibile prompts with real-time usage and is ambiguity-aware. The model also has a data-engine which is used to generate data through the model. Promptable segmentation The model generates a valid mask for a given prompt (even if ambiguous) as input. How is the ambiguity resolved? Ambiguous cases arise when the mutiple objects lie on top of each other. The image encoder is heavy - a pretrained ViT with masked autoencoder. The design choice for the masking involved masking around 75% of the patches. Unlike NLP tasks, vision tasks rely heavily on spatial information and neighbor patches can be reconstructed without much effort. Also, NLP tasks can get away with a simple MLP for decoders but vision taks require strong decoders. The model allows for prompts using points, box or text. The decoder has self-attention on the primpts followed by cross-attention with image and MLP for non-linearity to get masks. The model also estimates the IoU to rank masks. The emphasis of the model was also to make it universal. Since the encoder is heavy, the embeddings are precomputed after which the prompt encoder and mask decoder work quite fast. Data Engine There is no large-scale dataset available for training a segmentation model of this scale. Initially, the model has been trained iteratively on available datasets with several rounds of human correction. Following this, in the semi-automatic stage, the diversity of outputs (increasing ambiguity in overlapping objects) is improved by human refinement. Finally, in the fully automatic stage, prompting is introduced and masks with high IoU are preserved followed by NMS. Zero-shot transfer capabilities The idea is to fine-tune the model for specific tasks like edge-derection, object proposals and isntance segmentation. Future Trajectory Prediction This problem arises in many applications, particularly in autonomous driving. Given traffic participants and scene elements which are inter-dependent, we need to predict trajectories with scene awareness and multimodality. Humans are able to predict up to 10 seconds in highway scenes and plan their trajectory effectively whereas the SOTA models have a large gap in performance. More concretely, the algorithm takes a video sequence as an input, and needs to predict probabilistic trajectories which are diverse, have 3D awareness, capture semantics interactions and focus on long-term rewards. There are many components in these solutions including 3D localization module, generative sampling modules, semantic scene modules and scene aware fusion modules with encoders and decoders. # Representation Framework The past observed trajectories are represented by X={X_{i, t - l + 1}, \dots, X_{i, t}} usng we which we wish to predict future trajectory Y_i={Y_{i, t + 1}, \dots, Y_{i, t + \delta}}. The parameter \delta represents how far ahead we want to look in the future. The sample generation module produces future hypotheses \hat Y, and then a ranking module assigns a reward to each hypothesis considering long-term rewards. Following this, the refinement step calculates the displacement \Delta Y_t for the selected trajectory. Focusing on the sample generation module, the goal is to estimate posterior P(Y \vert X, I). Earlier, RNNs and other deterministic function maps from {X, I} to Y have been designed to address this. The problem with training in this approach is that the ground truth has a single future trajectory whereas the sampler predicts a distribution. How do we compare the two? Principal Component Analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique where data is linearly transformed onto a new coordinate system such that the directions (principal components) capturing the largest variation in the data can be easily identified. PCA works well when the data is near a linear manifold* in high dimensional spaces. CAn we approximate PCA with a Network? Train a network with a bottleneck hidden layer, and try to make the output the same as the input. Without any activations, the neural network simply performs least-squares minimization which essentially is the PCA algorithm. Adding non-linear activation functions would help the network map non-linear manifolds as well. This motivates for autoencoder networks. Autoencoders Network with a bottleneck layer that tries to reconstruct the input. The decoder can map latent vectors to images essentially helping us reconstruct images from a low-dimension. However, this is not truly generative yet since it learns a one-to-one mapping. An arbitrary latent vector can be far away from the learned latent space, and sampling new outputs is difficult. ### Variational Autoencoder This network extends the idea in autoencoders and trains the network to learn a Gaussian distribution (parametrized by $\mu, \sigma$) for the latent space. After learning, say, the normal distribution, sampling is quite easy to generate new samples representative of the trianing dataset using the decoder. To train this network, a distribution loss, like the KL-divergence is added in the latent space. But how do we backpropagate through random sampling? The reparametrization trick! Conditional Variational Autoencoder The encoder and decoder networks are now conditioned on the class variable. Conditional Diffusion Models Gradient of log, score function, conditioning at the cost of diversity - train a classifier and a diffusion model together in principle it’s fine. Potential issues - classifier can’t learn from noisy images and gradient of the classifier is not meaningful. Classifier-Free Guidance learn unconditional diffusion model $p_\theta(x)$ and use the conditional model $p_\theta(x \vert y)$ for some part of the training. this would not require any external classifier for training. CTG++ - Language Guided Traffic Simulation via Scene-Level Diffusion Testing autonomous agents in the real-world scenarios is expensive. Alternately, researchers aim to build good simulator that are realistic and can be controlled easily. Why not RL-based methods? Designed long-term reward functions is difficult for such scenarios. The goal here is in a generation regime rather than problem solving. Also, the focus here is on controllability rather than realism. For realism, the methods would be more data-driven. Trajectory Planning Recent works have proposed diffusion-models for planning algorithms using classifier-guidance. Diffuser for example, is one such work where the authors generate state action pairs which are guided using a reward function to generate paths in a maze. Traffic simulation methods Early works for this task rrelied on rule-based algorithms which were highly controllable but not very realistic. CTG One of the first workd for diffusion models for planning and conditional guidance for control with STL-based loss. Howeber, it modelled each agent independently which caused issues. CTG++ uses scene-level control Problem Formulation The state is given by the locations, speeds and angle of $M$ agents whose past history and local semantic maps are given. We aim to learn a distribution of trajectories given this information. The encoder represents the state action pairs in an embedded space on which temporal and cross attention on a diffusion based loss for training/ Inference The model uses LLMs to generate code for guidance function. Limitations and future work CTG++ is able to generate more realistic example, but is still far-off from realism. There are no ablation studies or emperical evaluations with complicated scenarios. Also, the multi-agent modeling can be improved for scalability. In conclusion, trajectory prediction requires generative models which are able to distinugish between feasible and infeasible trajectories. Variational Auto-Encoders have shown good performance for this task, and the current works aim to explore the scope of diffusion models in these tasks. LeapFrog - Stochastic Trajectory Prediction Similar to CTG++, this model aims to simulate real-world traffic scenarios. The authors aim for real-time predictions and better prediction accuracy. Leapfrog initializer skips over several steps of denoising and uses only few denoising steps to refine the distribtuion. System Architecture Leapfrog uses physics-inspired dynamics to reduce the number of steps required for the denoising process. The leapfrog initializer estimates mean trajectory for backbone of pericition, variance to control the prediction diversity and K samples simultaneously. Limitations The inference speed improved dramatically and achieves state of the art performance on the datasets. The model’s efficiency is higher for lower dimensional data and requires more work for scaling to higher dimensions. Structure from Motion The problem statement for structure from motion is - given a set of unordered or ordered set of images, estimate the relative positions of the cameras and recover the 3D structure of the world, typically as point clouds. In scenarios like autonomous driving, the images are ordered and the emphasis is on real-time performance. Feature Detection The first step involves identifying matching features across images to determine the camera movements. In unordered feature matching, the images to be compared are identified using vocabulary based retrieval methods to reduce the complexity from $\mathcal O(n^2)$ to $\log$ complexity. In the canonical coordinate system, the camera axis passes through the origin, and the $k$-axis points away from the camera. The $i$-axis and $j$-axis are parallel to the image plane. The projection of 3D points in the pixel space involves a non-linear operation - \[(x, y, z) \to (-d\frac{x}{z}, -d\frac{y}{z})\] where $d$ is the distance of the camera plane from the origin. For computational reasons, we want to convert these to a linear transformation. This is done via homogenous point representations - \[\underbrace{(\frac{x}{w}, \frac{y}{w})}_\text{Euclidean} \to\underbrace{(x, y, w)}_\text{Homogenous}\] Such representations are useful for ray marching operations. The camera transformation then becomes \[\begin{bmatrix}-d &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -d &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z \\ 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-dx \\ -dy \\ z\end{bmatrix}\] which represents $(-d\frac{x}{z}, -d\frac{y}{z})$ in Euclidean space. The matrix above can be decomposed as \[\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}-d &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -d &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}}_{K}\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}}_\text{projection}\] Here, we have considered a simple model for the camera intrinsics matrix $K$ whose general form is \[\begin{bmatrix}-d_x &amp; s &amp; c_x \\ 0 &amp; -d_y &amp; c_y \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\] where $\alpha = \frac{d_x}{d_y}$ is the aspect ratio (1 unless pixels are not square), $s$ is the skew, $c_x, c_y$ represent the translation of the camera origin wrt world origin. Coordinate Systems We need to determine the transformations between the world and camera coordinate systems. Since camera is a rigid body, the transformation is represented by a translation and a rotation. Considering these, the projection matrix becomes \[\Pi = K \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}R &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} T &amp; - c \\ 0 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\] Problem Formulation Given the projections $\Pi_i X_i \sim P_{ii}$, we aim to minimize a non-linear least squares of the form $G(R, T, X)$ - \[G(X, R, T) = \sum_{i = 1}^m \sum_{j = 1}^n w_{ij} \cdot \left\|P(X_i, R_j, t_j) - \begin{bmatrix}u_{i, j} \\v_{i, j}\end{bmatrix} \right\|^2\] This problem is called as Bundle Adjustment. Since this is an non-linear least squares, Levenberg-Marquardt is a popular choice to solve this. In theory, given enough number of points, we should get a unique solution. However, practically, we require a very good initialization to navigate the high-dimensional space. Also, outliers in the feature detection can deteriorate the performance of the model drastically. Tricks for Real-world performance Basically, we aim to make the feature detection very robust to remove all the possible outliers. Towards that, we note the following background Fundamental Matrix Given pixel coordinates $x_1, x_2$ of a point $x$ in two camera views, we define a fundamental matrix $F$ such that $x_1Fx_2 = 0$. The fundamental matrix is unique to the cameras and their relative configuration. It is given by \[\begin{align*} F &amp;= K_2^{-T} E K_1^{-1} \\ E &amp;= [t]_{\times} R \end{align*}\] where $R$ and $[t]_\times$represent the relative base transformations given by \[[t]_X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -t_z &amp; t_y \\ t_z &amp; 0 &amp; -t_x \\ -t_y &amp; t_x &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\] The matrix $E$ is called as the essential matrix which has similar properties as the fundamental matrix and is also independent of the camera parameters. The fundamental matrix is scale-invariant and has rank $2$. Therefore, it has $7$ degrees of freedom implying that we just need $8$ correctly configured points ($x$ and $y$) across the two pixel spaces to compute the fundamental matrix. We pose this problem as solving $Af = 0$ - minimizing $|Af|$ using SVD (to directly operate on the rank). This procedure is popularly known as the $8$-point algorithm. Furthermore, we can also use this to find the camera parameters by using more points. The essential matrix can be derived from $F$ using $RQ$ decomposition to obtain skew-symmetric and orthogonal matrices $[t]_\times$ and $R$. These matrices are what we were looking to determine - the relative configuration of the cameras with respect to each other. Now, triangulation can be used to locate $x$ in the 3D space. However, this may not work since the projection lines may not intersect in 3D space. To filter outliers, we will use the fundamental matrix as a model - it is a geometric property which all points have to abide by. However, the fundamental matrix itself is constructed from the detected features, which can be noisy. We need to design a robust method using heuristics to filter the outliers. We use a population-voting metric to choose the best model. RANSAC Suppose we are finding the best-fit line for a given set of points. For every pair of points, we determine the corresponding line and count the number of outliers for that particular line. The best model would then be the on which has the minimum number of outliers. This idea can be extended to any model, and it can be used to calculate the best fundamental matrix. The algorithm is as follows - Randomly choose $s$ samples - typically $s$ is the minimum sample size to git a model (7 for a Fundamental matrix) Fit a model to these samples Count the number of inliers that approximately fit the models. Repeat $N$ times Choose the model with the largest set of inliers. How do we choose $N$? It depends on the ratio of outliers to the dataset size, the minimum number of samples $s$ for the model and confidence score. We get \(N = \frac{\log(1 - p)}{\log(1 - (1 - \epsilon)^s)}\) Where $\epsilon$ is the proportion of outliers and $p$ is the confidence score. Bundle Adjustment Assuming we have a good $R, t$ robust to outliers with the above methods, we can now solve the least-squares problem to determine the scene geometry. Minimal Problems in computer Vision ### Three—point absolute pose estimation Assume the intrinsics of the camera are known. Determine the camera pose from given 3D-2D correspondences. Minimal case is 3 points: 6 degrees of freedom, 2 constraints per point $(u, v)$. Given $p_1, p_2, p_3$ in world coordinates, find positions In camera coordinates. Equivalently, determine how to move camera such that corresponding 2D-3D points align. ### Real-time SFM: Steady state Suppose we have point-cloud and poses available at frame $k$, find the pose in frame $k + 1$. #### Option 1 Find correspondences between consecutive frames, estimate the essential matrix and find $R, t$. Keep repeating this as frames are read. 5 point estimation #### Option 2 Estimate correspondences between point cloud and frame - 3 point absolute pose. Challenges - inliers calculations, which points to match. RANSAC maybe easier here. Option 1 is narrow baseline triangulation. ### Drift Problem Absolute scale is undeterminable. Why does scale matter? Noise and RANSAC. External measurements to fix this. ### Loop Closure Retrieval mechanism ## Lighting Unlike material properties and geometry, lighting is an external factor that is very complicated to infer. Lighting in a scene can.

We will cover discrete (finite probability spaces, tree models) as well as continuous math (Brownian Motion, Black-Scholes formula, Martingale theory).</p> <p>The theory in the course revolves around the “No Arbitrage theorem” which is closely related to one-price principle. Similarly, the idea of one-price principle theorizes that a set of investments with the same net outcome, albeit with different transactions, should have the same price.</p> <h2 id="financial-markets">Financial Markets</h2> <p>A <em>financial market</em> consists of tradable products such as stocks, bonds, currencies and indices. The market consists of two parties - the buyers and the sellers, who buy and sell these products respectively trying to make an <em>arbitrage</em> from the transactions. Formally, an <em>arbitrage opportunity</em> is a chance for a risk-free profit.</p> <h3 id="odds-and-arbitrage">Odds and Arbitrage</h3> <p>Let us consider the example of a horse race, where \(P(\text {S wins}) = 3/4\) and \(P(\text{W wins}) = 1/4\). How do we calculate the odds against \(W\) winning? It is given by \(P(\text{W wins})/P(\text{W loses}) = 3\). This situation is called \(3\text{-to-}1\) odds. That means, a dollar bet \(\$ 1\) brings \(\$ 3\) if \(W\) wins. Similarly, for \(S\), it brings \(\$ 0.3\). These bets are an example of a fair game, the net reward \(\frac{1}{4} (3) + \frac{3}{4}(-1)\) is \(0\).</p> <p>A <em>bookmaker</em> sets the odds for such scenarios. Consider an other example where the odds are \(9\text{-to-}5\) against \(W\) and \(2\text{-to-}5\) against \(S\). We claim that this results in an arbitrage for the bookmaker. To illustrate this, consider the bets \(\$ 10\) on \(S\) and \(\$ 5\) on \(W\). The payoff for the bookmaker when \(S\) wins is \(5 - 10\frac{2}{5} = 1\). When \(W\) wins, the profit is \(10 - 5\frac{9}{5} = 1\). A bookmaker typically decides the odds after the bets are made so that arbitrage is made in any scenarios.</p> <p>Ideally, one wants to make profit from such games. How do we do this? In the first example, we considered the probabilities and calculated the odds. To decide the odds for arbitrage, we do the reverse. In the above scenario, given the odds, the probabilities are \(P(S) \approx 71\%\) and \(P(W) \approx 36\%\). The probabilities add up to slightly above \(100\%\), which makes up the arbitrage for the bookmaker.</p> <h2 id="contingent-claim">Contingent Claim</h2> <p>A <strong>derivative</strong> or a <strong>contingent claim</strong> is a security whose value depends on the value of an underlying asset. Forward contracts, futures contracts and options are examples of such securities. Interestingly, the markets around the world also use derivatives whose underlying asset is also a derivative. Such securities are called as <em>structured products</em>.</p> <p>With such contrived products, it is important to choose a <em>fair price</em> to ensure there are no arbitrage opportunities in the market. To do so, we introduce the required mathematical notation - \(X\) is a real-valued random variable defined on a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal F, P)\) and \(\mathcal G\) is a sub-\(\sigma\)-algebra of \(\mathcal F\). For unfamiliar readers, in probability theory, a probability space consists of three elements -</p> <ul> <li>A sample space \(\Omega\), which is the set of all possible outcomes. For example, the sample space for a dice roll is \(\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).</li> <li>An event space or a set of events is represented by \(\mathcal F\). For example, the events constituting an odd dice roll is \(\mathcal F = \{1, 3, 5\}\).</li> <li>A probability function \(P\), assigns a probability (a number between \(0\) and \(1\)) to each event in the event space.</li> </ul> <p>The term \(\sigma\)-algebra on a set \(X\) refers to a nonempty collection \(\Sigma\) of subsets of \(X\) closed under complement, countable unions, and countable intersections. The pair \((X, \Sigma)\) is called a <strong>measurable space</strong>.</p> <p>In general, we model the price of a contract with a random variable \(X\) that evolves across time with \(X(w) \geq 0\) (all the values for the random variable are positive). For example, for the <em>call option</em> described in #options, we have</p> \[X(w) = (S(w)_t - K)^+\] <p>Similarly, for a <em>put</em> option, where the holder has the right to sell a certain asset at a fixed price, we get</p> \[X(w) = (K - S_T)^+\] <p>There can be other kinds of <em>structured products</em> like</p> <ul> <li> \[X = \max(S_1, \dots, S_T)\] </li> <li> \[X = \left(\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t = 1}^T S_t - K\right)^+\] </li> </ul> <p>In the above definitions, the variables \(w, S_t\) capture the evolution of price across time, and are described in the later section. The key takeaway is that, we are trying to price a contingent claim \(X\) - find \(C_0(X)\)</p> <h3 id="forwards-contract">Forwards Contract</h3> <p>A <strong>forward constract</strong> is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a <em>certain</em> future time for a <em>certain</em> price. Consider the following example,</p> <ul> <li>\(A\) agrees at time \(t = 0\) to sell one share at time \(T\) for \(\$ F\). We assume that \(A\) buys the share at \(t = 0\) at price \(S_0\).</li> <li>\(B\) agrees at time \(t = 0\) to buy one share at time \(T\) for \(\$ F\)</li> </ul> <p>We assume that \(A, B\) don’t invest their own money, and borrow money from the bank to perform transactions. Given such a scenario, how do we decide a <em>fair price</em> \(F\)? To simplify the calculations, we assume the following -</p> <ul> <li>No transaction costs or dividends.</li> <li>Market is liquid - every transaction has a buyer and seller available.</li> <li>Investor is <em>small</em> compared to the market. That is, the action of the investor is not momentous enough to change the price of the stock in the market.</li> <li>Short selling/borrowing of stock is allowed.</li> </ul> <p>\(B\) can invest the amount in the bank for a <em>continuous compound</em> interest rate \(r\) during this term. The claim is that \(F = S_0 e^{rT}\) where \(S_0\) is the price of the share at \(t = 0\). To analyze this, we consider the following cases -</p> <ul> <li> \[F &gt; S_0 e^{rT}\] <p>\(A\) sells the share for \(\$ F\) and repays the loan of \(\$ S_0\) with interest - \(\$ S_0 e^{rT}\). The profit \(A\) gets is \(F - S_0 e^{rT}\)</p> </li> <li> \[F &gt; S_0e^{rT}\] <p>\(B\) short sells one share for \(\$ S_0\) and invests \(\$ S_0\) in the bank. The money in the bank will grow to \(S_0 e^{rT}\) at \(t = T\), and \(B\) buys one share at \(F\). The profit for \(B\) here is \(S_0 e^{rT} - F &gt; 0\)</p> </li> </ul> <p>So the fair price is \(S_0 e^{rT}\) where neither \(A\) nor \(B\) can take advantage.</p> <p><em>Note.</em> A <strong>futures contract</strong> is similar to a forward contract but is traded on a financial exchange. They typically have a delivery month rather than a delivery date, and are followed by a settlement procedure called <em>marking to market</em>.</p> <h3 id="options">Options</h3> <p>An <strong>option</strong> is a contract which gives the holder of the option the right, but not the obligation, to buy other sell a given security at a given price (called the <em>strike</em> price) within a fixed time period \([0, T]\). A <strong>call option</strong> gives the option holder the right to buy at the given price, whereas the <em>put option</em> gives the option holder the right to sell at the given price.</p> <h1 id="european-call-options">European Call Options</h1> <p>A <em>European option</em> can only be exercised by the holder of the option at the expiration time \(T\) (unlike an American Option, which will be discussed in the later sections). We have the following equation for profit of a <em>call option</em> holder, assuming the option is free -</p> \[P = (S_T - K)^+ = \begin{cases} S_T - K &amp; S_T &gt; K \\ 0 &amp; S_T \leq K \end{cases}\] <p>How do we decide the <em>fair price</em> at \(t = 0\) for the option? We need to use probability results to model the price movement to decide this. In discrete time settings, we use different models like Cox, Ross and Rubenstein. In continuous time frame, we use Brownian motion using the Black-Scholes model. In both cases, there exists a unique fair price. However, if the product is slightly more complicated, then there is no unique fair price.</p> <h2 id="binomial-model">Binomial Model</h2> <p>Also known as <strong>Cox-Ross-Rubenstein Model (CRR)</strong> is a discrete time model for a financial market defined for \(t = 0, 1, \dots, T\). At each time instant the model considers the following two types of assets</p> <h4 id="bonds">Bonds</h4> <p>Considered as a risk-free asset, a <em>bond</em> yields at a constant rate of return \(r \geq 0\) over each time period. The price is modeled as \(B_t = B_0 (1 + r)^t\) for \(t = 0, 1, \dots, T\). \(B_0\) is typically assumed as \(1\).</p> <h4 id="stocks">Stocks</h4> <p>Stocks are considered as risk-models where the price evolution is captured using binomial random variables. We consider the model \(S_t = s_o \zeta_1 \dots \zeta_{t_1} = S_{t - 1} \zeta_t\) where \(S_0 &gt; 0\) is the constant initial price. That is, the stock price process is modeled as an <em>exponential random walk</em>. In this model, we assume \(P(\zeta_t = u) = p\) and \(P(\zeta_t = d) = 1- p\) where \(0 &lt; d &lt; 1 + r &lt; u\) where \(d, u\) are the down and up movements respectively. That is, \(S_{t + 1} = S_t u\) represents the price of the stock if the price has moved upward at time \(t\).</p> <p>Concretely, the probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal F, P)\) is such that \(\Omega\) is the finite set of \(2^T\) possible outcomes for the values of stock price \((T + 1)\)-tuple (for \(S_0, S_1, \dots, S_T)\), \(\mathcal F\) is the \(\sigma\)-algebra consisting of all possible subsets of \(\Omega\), and \(P\) is the probability measure on \((\Omega, \mathcal F)\) associated with the Bernoulli probability \(p\).</p> <p>Let the field \(\mathcal F_0 = \{ \phi, \Omega\}\) and</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathcal F_1 &amp;= \sigma(S_1) \\ &amp;= \{ \phi, \Omega, \{w: S_1(w) = S_0u \}, \{w: S_1(w) = S_0 d\}\} \\ &amp;= \sigma(\{S_1 = S_0u\}), \{S_1 = S_0d\}) \end{align*}\] <p>This is a partition of \(\Omega\). Similarly, for \(t = 2\), we get</p> <p>\(\mathcal F_1 = \{ \phi, \Omega, \{uu, ud\}, \{dd, du\}\}\). Extrapolating this,</p> \[\mathcal F_t = \sigma(S_1, \dots, S_t) = \sigma(\zeta_2, \dots, \zeta_t)\] <p>We get \(\#(\mathcal F)_t = 2^t\). This evolution can be represented using a binomial tree of the following form -</p> \[\begin{align*} &amp;\boxed{} \\ \boxed{d} &amp;\quad \boxed{u} \\ \boxed{dd} \quad \boxed {du} &amp;\quad \boxed{ud} \quad \boxed{uu} \\ &amp;\dots \end{align*}\] <h2 id="trading-strategies-and-fair-pricing">Trading Strategies and Fair Pricing</h2> <p>A strategy \(\phi\) in stocks and bonds consists of sequence of random variable pairs \(\phi = \{(\alpha_t, \beta_t); t = 1, \dots, T\}\) where \(\alpha_t\) represents the holdings of a stock and \(\beta_t\) represents the holdings of a bond on day \(t\) (The unit for time can be taken as minutes, hours, etc., but we consider days). We also have the following assumptions</p> <ol> <li>Predictability: \(\alpha_t, \beta_t \in \mathcal F_{t - 1}, t = 1, \dots, T\)</li> <li>Self-financing: \(\alpha_t S_t + \beta_t B_t = \alpha_{t + 1} S_t + \beta_{t + 1}B_t\). That is, there is no influx or outflux of money asides from the changes in the underlying assets. We have some initial investment and assume that \(\alpha_1, \beta_1\) are \(\mathcal F_0\)-measurable are constant.</li> </ol> <p>The value of the portfolio at time \(t\) is given by \(V_t(\phi) = \alpha_t S_t + \beta_t B_t, t = 1, \dots, T\) and \(V_0(\phi) = \alpha_1 S_0 + \beta B_0 = \alpha_1 S_1 + \beta_1\) We can now define the concept of <strong>arbitrage</strong> formally.</p> <h3 id="arbitrage">Arbitrage</h3> <p>An arbitrage is a trading strategy \(\phi\) such that \(V_0(\phi) = 0\) and \(V_t(\phi) \geq 0\). That is, we don’t have any initial investment and get a profit at time \(t = T\). However, note that \(V_t(\phi)\) is a random variable, so the inequality is assumed to be a point-wise inequality wherein \(V_T(\phi)(w) \geq 0, \forall w \in \Omega\). This is a stronger assumption than \(P(V_T(\phi) &gt; 0) &gt; 0 \equiv E(V_T(\phi)) &gt; 0 \equiv V_T(\phi)(w) &gt; 0\) for some \(w \in \Omega\). Notice that the last equivalence does not have any probability term in the expression. This equivalence is important to note since it makes the definition invariant of the underlying probability assumptions.</p> <h3 id="hedge">Hedge</h3> <p>A hedging or a replicating strategy \(\phi\) has the property \(V_T(\phi) = X\). That is, to price a contingent claim \(X\), if we find a trading strategy \(\phi\) with cost (initial investment) \(V_0(\phi)\), such that \(V_T(\phi) = X\), then \(V_0(\phi)\) is a fair price of \(X\) by the one-price principle. Essentially, with the price “\(V_0(\phi)\)” we bought an opportunity that resulted in a value of “\(V_T(\phi)\)” at time \(T\). If a contingent claim \(X\) has the same value at time \(T\), then its fair price should be \(V_0(\phi)\) at \(t = 0\).</p> <p>Using this as a motivation, let us price a European call option. Our approach is as follows - an investment in the underlying stock and a bond should result in the same outcome as an investment in the option itself. The movements in the option will be correlated with those of the underlying stock, allowing us to correctly determine a fair price at every time instant.</p> <h4 id="hedging-for-t--1">Hedging for \(T = 1\)</h4> <p>Consider the following example, where we try to hedge \(X\) at \(t = 1\). That is, we are trying to find a strategy \(\phi = (\alpha_1, \beta_1)\) such that \(V_1(\phi) = \alpha_1 S_1 + \beta_1 B_1\equiv X\).</p> <p>We have two cases based on the stock movement -</p> <ul> <li> \[\alpha_1 S_0 u + \beta_1 (1 + r) = X^u\] </li> <li> \[\alpha_1 S_0 d + \beta_1 (1 + r) = X^d\] </li> </ul> <p>Equivalently, \(\alpha_1 S_0(u - d) = X^u - X^d\)</p> \[\begin{align*} \alpha_1 &amp;= \frac{X^u - X^d}{u - d}\frac{1}{S_0} \\ \beta_1 &amp;= \frac{uX^d - d X^u}{u - d}\frac{1}{B_1} \end{align*}\] <p>What do the above expressions mean? Investing \(\alpha_1\) in stock and \(\beta_1\) in bond at the end of day \(0\) will result in same price as \(X\) on day \(1\). Manipulating the expressions further,</p> \[\begin{align*} V_0 (\phi) &amp;= \alpha_1 S_0 + \beta_1 \\ &amp;= \frac{X^u - X^d}{u- d} + \frac{uX^d - d X^u}{u - d}\frac{1}{1 + r} \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{1 + r}\left\{X^u \left(\frac{1 + r - d}{u - d}\right) + X^d \left(\frac{u - 1 - r}{u - d}\right)\right\} \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{1 + r} \mathbb E^* (X) \end{align*}\] <p>The above expression is reminiscent of an expectation formulation where \(p^* = \frac{1 + r - d}{u - d}\) and \(0 &lt; p^* &lt; 1\). Here, the set of discounted stock prices \(\{S_0, S_1/(1 + r)\}\) form a \(p^*\)-martingale.</p> <p>What is a Martingale? A <strong>Martingale</strong> is a sequence of random variables representing a stochastic process for which, at a particular time, the conditional expectation of the next value in the sequence is equal to the present value, regardless of all prior values.</p> <p>In the above case, we have</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathbb E^* (S_1/(1 + r) \vert \mathcal F_0) &amp;= S_0 u \cdot p^* + S_0 d \cdot (1 - p)^* \\ &amp;= S_0 \implies \mathbb E^*(S_1) = S_0(1 + r) \end{align*}\] <p>It is important to realize that computing expectations under \(p^*\) is a mathematical device. We are not assuming that the stock price actually moves according to this probability. That is, \(p^*\) may be unrelated to the subjective probability \(p\) that we associate with the binomial model for movements in the stock price.</p> <p><strong>Theorem 1 (T = 1)</strong> <em>For a given \(X\), the value \(\mathbb E^*(X)/(1 + r)\) is the non-arbitrage price of \(X\) at \(t = 0\).</em> <em>Proof.</em> Let \(C_0\) is the market price of the contingent claim \(X\) and \(V_0 = \mathbb E^*(X)/(1 + r) = V_0(\bar \phi)\) where \(\bar \phi = (\bar \alpha_1, \bar \beta_1)\) (the values we calculated before). Consider the following cases -</p> <ol> <li> <p>Say \(C_0 &gt; V_0\) To make an arbitrage in this situation, we sell \(X\) for \(C_0\). We invest the amount \(V_0\) in the stock and amount \(C_0 - V_0 &gt; 0\) in bonds at \(t = 0\). At time \(t = 1\), we get \(V_1(\bar \phi) = X\) yielding \((C_0 - V_0)(1 + r) &gt; 0\) as profit from the bond.</p> </li> <li> <p>Say \(C_0 &lt; V_0\) We do the opposite from above, where we buy the asset \(X\). Short sell \(\bar \phi\) for \(V_0\), and invest \(C_0\) in \(X\) and \(V_0 - C_0\) in the bond. We get the profit \((V_0 - C_0)(1 + r)\) at \(t = 1\).</p> </li> <li> <p>Say \(C_0 = V_0\) Here, we can show that no one can make an arbitrage. Consider the strategy in stock, bond and contingent claim \(\psi = (\alpha_1, \beta_1, \gamma_1)\). We need to argue that no arbitrage can be made with any such strategy. We have,</p> </li> </ol> \[\begin{align*} V_0(\psi) &amp;= \alpha_1 S_0 + \beta_1 + \gamma_1 C_0 \\ V_1(\psi) &amp;= \alpha_1 S_1 + \beta B_1 + \gamma_1 X \\ \implies \mathbb E^*(V_1(\psi)) &amp;= \mathbb E^*(\alpha_1 S_1 + \beta_1 B1 + \gamma_1 X) \\ &amp;= \alpha_1 \mathbb E^*(S_1) + \beta_1 (1 + r) + \gamma_1 \mathbb E^*(X) \end{align*}\] <p>We can distribute the expectation this way due to the linearity property. Recall that, we typically assume \(B_0 = 1\) for brevity. Continuting the calculations,</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathbb E^*(V_1(\psi)) &amp;= \alpha_1 S_1(1 + r) + \beta_1(1 + r) + \gamma_1 V_0 (\bar \phi)(1 + r) \\ &amp;= \alpha_1 S_1(1 + r) + \beta_1(1 + r) + \gamma_1 C_0 (1 + r) \\ &amp;= (1 + r) V_0 (\psi) \end{align*}\] <p>If \(V_0(\psi) = 0\), then \(\mathbb E^*(V_1(\psi)) = 0\), and if \(V_1(\psi) \geq 0\), then \(P^*(V_1(\psi) = 0) = 1\). That is, \(V_1(\psi) = 0\) meaning no arbitrage can be made with any strategy \(\psi\).</p> <h4 id="general-t">General \(T\)</h4> <p>This analysis can be extended to derive the hedging strategy a general \(t &gt; 1\).

To derive such a strategy, we work backwards in time starting from \(V_T(\phi) = X\).

We can compute \(Z_t\) since it is a finite optimization problem. Since \(\{Y_t\}\) form a martingale, we get</p> \[Z_t \geq \mathbb[Y_T \vert \mathcal F_t] = Y_t\] <p>We use this result to show that \(Z_t\) form a supermartingale.

So far, we have shown (1) and (2) in the claim. Also, in the above proof, we use the following property. Let \(X_t\) be a supermartingale ifor \(t \leq \tau \leq T\). Then \(\mathbb E(X_\tau \vert \mathcal F_t) \leq X_t\). The proof is left as an exercise.</p> <p>How do we show (3) and (4) in the claim. For (4), we simply need to check the martingale property</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathbb E[Z_{(t + 1) \wedge \bar \tau} - Z_{t \wedge \bar \tau} \vert \mathcal F_t] &amp;\stackrel{?}{=} 0 \\ &amp;= \mathbb E[\mathbb 1_{t &lt; \bar \tau}(Z_{(t + 1) \wedge \bar \tau} - Z_{t \wedge \bar \tau} \vert \mathcal F_t] \\ &amp;= \mathbb E[\mathbb 1_{t &lt; \tau} (Z_{t + 1} = Z_t) \vert \mathcal F_t] \\ &amp;= \mathbb 1_{t &lt; \bar \tau} \left(\mathbb E(Z_{t + 1} \vert F_t) - Z_t\right) \\ \end{align*}\] <p>where \(\bar \tau(w) = \tau^*(0) (w)\).

This proves the required property.</p> <p>The last argument is to show that, given a supermartingale \(\tilde Z\) with \(\tilde Z_t \geq Y_t\) for all \(t\), then \(\tilde Z_t = Z_t\) for all \(t\). This proves uniqueness.</p> <p>We have</p> \[\begin{align*} \tilde Z_{t - 1} &amp;= \max(Y_{t - 1}, \mathbb E(\tilde Z \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1})) \\ &amp;\leq \max(Y_{t - 1}, \mathbb E(Z_t \vert \mathcal F_{t -1})) \\ &amp;\leq \max(Y_{t - 1}, Z_{t - 1}) = Z_{t - 1} \end{align*}\] <p>We have already shown that \((Z_t)_{t - 0}^T\) is the least supermartingale majorant of \((Y_t)_{t = 0}^T\).

We have been studying these problems since many years, and there is a significant amount of research in this topic. There are other schemes based on other assumptions like code based cryptographies, etc. These are important in the case Lattices are broken since these have completely independent assumptions.</p> <p>What is Lattice? A Lattice is defined over a space \(\mathbb R^n\) consisting of \(m\) linearly independent vectors \(b_1, \dots, b_m\). We refer to the matrix \(B = (b_1, \dots, b_m)\). Then,</p> \[\mathcal L(B) = \left\{ \sum_{i} x_i b_i \vert z_i \in \mathbb Z \right\}\] <p>We usually consider \(m = n\) in analysis. For example, in \(\mathbb R^2\), \(b_1 = (1, 2)^T, b_2 = (2, 1)^T\). This is equivalent to considering the integer grid points in the basis \(B\). This is a countable space unlike a normal vector space. A lattice is not unique to set of basis vectors! Any basis of the form \(x_1b_1 + x_2 b_2, y_1 b_1 + y_2 b_2\), where \(x_1y_2 - x_2y_1 = \pm 1\) and \(x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 \in \mathbb Z\) will have the same basis.</p> <p>Consider a few computational problems in Lattices -</p> <ul> <li>Given \(v, B\), compute whether \(v \in \mathcal L(B)\). This is polynomial computable using Gaussian elimination.</li> <li>Given \(B, B’\), compute whether \(\mathcal L(B) = \mathcal L(B’)\). This is polynomial computable as well, using the above problem. An equivalent way to find this is to consider \(B = UB’\) iff \(U\) has integer entries and \(det(U) = \pm 1\) as seen above.</li> <li>SVP (Shortest Vector Problem) - Given a basis \(B\) in \(\mathbb R^n\), find the non-zero shortest vector in \(\mathcal L(B)\). This is computationally hard for higher \(n\) (quantumly hard too). An approximation is given by \(SVP_\gamma\) aims to find \(v \in \mathcal L(B)\), \(\|v\| \leq \gamma \|\text{shortest}\|\).</li> <li>CVP (Closest Vector Problem) - Given a basis \(B \in \mathbb R^n\) and \(v \in \mathbb R^n\), find \(v \in \mathcal L(B)\) such that \(\|u - v\|\) is minimized. This problem is equivalent to the above problem.</li> </ul> <p>Conjectures - SVP and CVP are quantumly hard!</p> <p>Can we use NP-complete problems for cryptography? Most of these problems are worst-case hard, and there are good approximation algorithms for the average case. So with these problem constructions, we are looking for average-case hard complexity. The knapsack problem, for example, is related to Lattice problems.</p> <p>How can we construct public key cryptography schemes with lattices? The basis assumption is that computing a ‘good’ basis from a ‘bad’ basis is intractable. For example, consider the following</p> <ul> <li>A secret key is constructed using a ‘good’ basis (for CVP) - \(B\)</li> <li>A public key is constructed using a ‘bad’ basis - \(B’\)</li> <li>\({\sf Enc} (pk, m) \to \text{ sample } v \in \mathcal L(B')\) such that \(v\) encodes \(m\). The cipher text is \(u = v + \eta\) where usually \(\eta \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)\) so that the problem reduces to CVP</li> <li>\({\sf Dec}(sk, u)\) recovers \(v\) using \(B\).</li> </ul> <p>There are more computationally hard problems like the SIS (Shortest Integer Solution) and LWE (Learning with Errors). SIS and LWE can be reduced to one another and both of them are harder than \(SVP/SVP_\gamma\) and \(CVP/CVP_\gamma\). For example, Learning With Errors is much harder problem - it is average case hard if \(CVP_\gamma\) is worst case hard for \(\gamma = {\sf poly}(n)\). These problems, especially LWE, present a new paradigm in cryptography known as <em>homographic encryption</em>. The idea is that any operations performed on the messages (decrypted space) can be reflected in the encrypted space. For example, say we are encrypting photos uploaded to the cloud. If you are adding a new picture, then we should be able to encrypt the new data alongside the old one without recomputing the encryption for the data as a whole again. In homographic encryption, we need not perform the encryption again for all the set of pictures, but rather just on the new picture and append it to the old data.</p> <p>Let us see the definitions of these problems -</p> <ul> <li>Shortest Integer Solution - Let \(A \in \mathbb Z^{n \times m}_q\), \(A = (a_1, \dots, a_m)\) \(a_i \in \mathbb Z_q\). The goal is to find \(z \in \mathbb Z^m\) such that <ul> <li> \[Az \equiv 0 ({\sf mod } q)\] </li> <li>\(z\) is ‘short’ - \(\|z\|_2 \leq \beta\) and \(z \in \{-1, 0, 1\}^m\)</li> </ul> <p>The parameters used to define this problem are given by \(m = {\sf poly} (n)\), \(q = {\sf poly} (n)\) and \(\beta = c \sqrt{m}\) for some \(c \in \mathbb R\). These parameter choices can be chosen to be something else if the theoretical bounds exist, but this particular set of parameters can be reduced to \(CVP_\gamma\) where \(\gamma = \mathcal O(n)\).</p> <p>There is a variant of this problem known as Inhomogeneous Short Integer Solution (ISIS) - We equate \(Az \equiv t ({\sf mod} q)\) instead of equating to \(0\).</p> <p>How are these related to lattices? All solutions \(Az \equiv 0 ({\sf mod } q)\) form a lattice defined by</p> \[L^\perp(A) = \left\{z \in \mathbb Z^m \vert Az \equiv 0 ({\sf mod } q)\right\}\] <p>Consider any \(z_1, z_2 \in \mathcal L^\perp(A)\), then it is easy to see that for any \(a, b \in \mathbb Z\), \(A(az_1 + bz_2) \equiv 0({\sf mod}q)\). Let us define a cryptographic application to get a gist of how we use these problems -</p> <ol> <li>Collision-Resistant Hash Function - The security for such a function is that, given the description of such a hash function, it is <em>difficult</em> to find a collision. Using Grover’s Algorithm, typical hash functions can be broken with a quadratic speed-up as compared to classical algorithms. Here, we construct a hash function using SIS that cannot be broken with Grover’s - <ul> <li>Construction - Sample \(A \in \mathbb Z_q^{m\times n}\), \(f_A(x \in \{0, 1\}^m) = Ax ({\sf mod} q)\). Unlike SIS, the input here is binary rather than from \(\mathbb Z_q\).</li> <li>Security - Assume we find \(x, x’\) such that \(f_A(x) = f_A(x’) \implies A(x - x') \equiv 0 ({\sf mod} q)\). Since \(x, x’ \in \{0, 1\}^m\), \(x - x’ \in \{-1, 0, 1\}^m\).</li> </ul> <p>There are other implementations more efficient that this construction, but it acts like a good starting point.</p> </li> <li>Signatures (GPV Signature) - Unlike the previous case, this is the most efficient construction we know for public key cryptography. For a signature, we need to define the constructions for a verification key \(vk\) and a signing key \(sk\) - a trapdoor \(T\) to help us find solutions for ISIS. <ul> <li>\(Sign(sk, m)\) maps \(m \mapsto t \in \mathbb Z_q^m\), use \(T\) to find \(v\) such that \(Av \equiv t ({\sf mod} q)\) and set \(sk = \sigma = v\).</li> <li>\(Ver(vk, m, \sigma)\) maps \(m \mapsto t \in \mathbb Z_q^m\), check whether \(A \sigma \equiv t ({\sf mod} q)\) and \(\sigma\) is ‘short’.</li> </ul> <p>Intuitively, we are able to find a secret key \(v\) using a trapdoor that satisfied ISIS. The verification procedure is simple wherein \(v\) can be verified to be short and satisfying the modulus equation.</p> <p>The research for \(T\) concluded in 2010’s. The gist of the trapdoor is the following - suppose we sample \(A \in \mathbb Z^{n \times m}_q\) and \(t \gets \text{ all short vectors}\). Then, we construct \(A' = [A \vert \texttt{-}At] \equiv A' \in \mathbb Z_1^{n \times (m + 1)}\). Then \(t’ = (t, 1)^T\) satisfies \(A’t’ \equiv 0({\sf mod} q)\).</p> <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) submitted FALCON and DILITHIUM based on GPV signatures along with other building blocks for post-quantum cryptography.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The SIS problem still has limited structure limiting its applications. Next, we shall see LWE which allows us to construct many cryptographic schemes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learning With Errors (LWE) - The parameters used in this problem are \(n, m , q, \mathcal X\) where \(m,q = poly(n)\) and \(\mathcal X\) is an error probability distribution. The problem is as follows - say there is a uniformly random \(s \in \mathbb Z_q^n\), then the goal is to given \(m = poly(n)\) samples of \(\langle a_i, s\rangle + \eta_i \equiv ({\sf mod} q)\) where \(a_i \in \mathbb Z_q^n\) and \(\eta \sim \mathcal X^m\), determine \(s\). Note that if there were no error involved, then this problem is very easy - perform Gaussian elimination to recover \(a_i\). \(\mathcal X\) is typically chosen as a Gaussian distribution modified to work with the \(\mathbb Z_q\) space -</p> \[\Psi_\alpha = \text{sample } v \in \mathbb Z_q \\ \text{w.p. proportional to } \left(e^{\frac{-|v|^2}{\alpha^2}}/c\right)\] <p>where \(\alpha = \mathcal O\left(1/\sqrt{n}\right)\).</p> <p>More elegantly, the LWE problem is described using a matrix formulation -</p> <p>Given \(A \in \mathbb Z^{n \times m}_q\) and \(e \sim X^m\) , determine \(s \in Z_q^n\) from \(s^T A + e^T ({\sf mod} q)\). This is known as the <em>search version</em> of LWE. <em>Distinguish LWE</em> is an equivalent formulation where, given \(A, e, s\) with the same distributions as before, the goal is to distinguish \(A, s^T A + e^T\) and \(A, r^T\) where \(r \in \mathbb Z^m_q\). To get an intuition, we consider the following example schemes -</p> </li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>Public-key Encryption -</p> <p>Kyber is one such scheme, motivated from this, which is now being used by Apple (as of 2024) to encrypt messages on iMessage. SABER, NTRU are other public-key encryption schemes.</p> <ul> <li> \[pk = A, u = s^T A + e^T\] </li> <li> \[sk = s\] </li> <li>\({\sf Enc} (pk, m \in \{0, 1\}^n) :=\) choose \(x \in \{0, 1\}^m\) and output \(c_0 = Ax ({\sf mod} q), c_1 = \left(ux + \left[\frac{q}{2}\right].m \right)({\sf mod} q)\)</li> <li> <p>\({\sf Dec}(sk, c_0, c_1) :=\) output</p> \[\begin{align*} c_1 - s^T c_0 &amp;= \left(ux + \left[\frac{q}{2}\right].m - s^T Ax\right) {\sf mod } q \\ v &amp;= \left(e^T x + \left[\frac{q}{2}\right].m \right) {\sf mod } q \end{align*}\] <p>Now, since \(x \in \{0, 1\}^m\) and \(e\) is ‘short’, we can bound \(\|e^Tx \| &lt; q/4\) (A loose bound). We have the following range for \(v\).</p> \[\begin{align*} 0 |————|\underbrace{————|————}|————| q \\ m = 0 \quad\quad\quad\quad m = 1 \quad\quad\quad\quad m = 0 \quad \end{align*}\] </li> <li><strong>Security -</strong> Consider the following two problems - <ul> <li>Given \(pk = A, u = s^T A + e^T\), and \(c_0 = Ax, c_1 = ux + \frac{q}{2} m\), find \(m\).</li> <li>Given \(pk = A, u = r^T\) and \(c_0 = Ax, c_1 = ux + \frac{q}{2}m\), find \(m\)</li> </ul> <p>Now, distinguishing the above two scenarios is equivalent to solving the DLWE problem! This proves the security.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Key-Agreement Protocol - In this scenario, we want two parties \(A, B\) to establish a secret key. Let us say \(A, B\) have a common matrix \(M \in \mathbb Z_q^{n \times n}\) they agree on.</p> <ul> <li>To do so, \(A\) samples \(r \in \mathbb Z^n\) and \(B\) samples \(s \in \mathbb Z^n\) such that \(r, s\) are short. This ensures that \(r, s\) are in \(Z_q^n\) as well. They also have associated error distributions \(e, e’\) respectively.</li> <li>\(A\) sends \(u^T = r^T M + e^T\) and \(B\) sends \(v = Ms + e\)</li> <li>\(A\) computes \(r^Tv = r^T(As + e’) \approx r^T As\)</li> <li>\(B\) computes \(u^T s = (rA + e^T) s \approx r^T As\)</li> <li>To avoid the small chance of error, \(A, B\) choose the first \(m\) bits of the obtained values. The error will most likely not affect these bits, and both parties obtain the same key.</li> <li>For an eavesdropper, both \(u^T, v\) are completely random and the security is guaranteed by LWE.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>LWE has properties such begin fully homomorphic and identity-based (encrypt the message for a specific group of secret-keys). LWE can also be used for the proof of quantumness.</p> <p>The bigger picture has more problems as compared to LWE. However, the theory for LWE is robust and therefore is widely used in post-quantum cryptographic protocols.</p> <h2 id="quantum-computers">Quantum Computers</h2> <p>How do we make qubits, gates and quantum computers. The first Turing complete programmable computer is the ENIAC. It was built using vacuum tubes and occupied a lot of space. After that we transitioned to transistors, and the growth has been exponential. Since 1950’s to 2010’s, we were able to progress from 1 transistor to 1-trillion transistors packed in the same area. This was correctly predicted by the Moore’s law - the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles roughly every two years (or eighteen months).</p> <p>In quantum computers, we are currently at the initial stage like the ENIAC - trying to figure out how to efficiently store the qubits. The following technologies are being experimented with -</p> <ul> <li>Atoms - Trapped Ions, Cold Atoms - We prepare individual wells or <em>prisons</em> where ions are trapped electromagnetically. Two ions trapped can represent an entangled state. Lasers are used to control the properties of these ions. The qubits remain coherent for an impressive amount of time - for a few minutes. Typically, qubits are heavily influenced by the environment - the environment gets decohered easily. However, this technology is not easy to scale - the best we can do is 30 qubits. Also, applying 2-qubit gates using lasers is quite difficult.</li> <li>Superconductors - The idea is to cool certain metals to \(0K\) - The materials then lose their electromagnetic properties. When two metals close together are cooled down, then they form a qubit due to <em>quantum tunnelling effect</em>. The operations are still conducted by lasers but the scalability is better. The quantum computers currently being used by Google and IBM are made from this technology. The accuracy is not high but scalability is easy (these companies use those big numbers to increase stock prices). The longevity is in the order of microseconds!</li> <li>Photons - There are some controversies with photons, with regards to using them as universal qubits. The qubits are formed using circulating in waveguides using the polarity of photons. This are difficult to scale and it is difficult to use them for ‘quantum speedup’ algorithms.</li> <li>Silicon dots - Artificial atoms made by adding an electron to silicon and these are controlled by microwaves. This is still in the experimental stage.</li> </ul> <p>Currently, the accuracy for quantum gates is not as good for consumer use - the accuracy is 99.9%. IonQ based on trapped ions is currently at around ~35 qubits whereas IBM based on superconducting technology is at a 1000 qubits. However, the error per qubit in the latter case is around 2% making it infeasible to do any practical applications with these chips. Both these strides in accuracy and size are needed to reach quantum supremacy. How many years would it take to reach fault-tolerant quantum computers with a million qubits? We are not sure. The problem is not with the technology, but with the engineering - quantum computers require a lot of calibration to work with a good accuracy.</p> <p>Recently, a few noisy qubits (53 in total) were able to outperform the fastest classical computers on the Poisson sampling problem. The fastest classical computers would take around 10,000 years to solve this problem!<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> This shows promise in the era of quantum computing.</p> <p><a name="footnote1">1</a>: IBM showed that this result is feasible using their classical supercomputer which took 2 days to solve the problem. Even then, a few qubits solved this in minutes, so quantum supremacy is still a promising avenue.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Notes"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction to lattice problems and their relevance in post-quantum cryptography.

Object detection can be performed using either traditional (1) image processing techniques or modern (2) deep learning networks.</p> <ul> <li>Image processing techniques generally don’t require historical data for training and are unsupervised in nature. OpenCV is a popular tool for image processing tasks. <ul> <li>Pros: Hence, those tasks do not require annotated images, where humans labeled data manually (for supervised training).</li> <li>Cons: These techniques are restricted to multiple factors, such as complex scenarios (without unicolor background), occlusion (partially hidden objects), illumination and shadows, and clutter effect.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Deep Learning methods generally depend on supervised or unsupervised learning, with supervised methods being the standard in computer vision tasks. The performance is limited by the computation power of GPUs, which is rapidly increasing year by year. <ul> <li>Pros: Deep learning object detection is significantly more robust to occlusion, complex scenes, and challenging illumination.</li> <li>Cons: A huge amount of training data is required; the process of image annotation is labor-intensive and expensive.

Each cell in the grid is responsible for localizing and predicting the class of the object that it covers, along with the probability/confidence value.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Object%20Detection/Untitled%201.png" alt="Untitled"/></p> </li> <li> <p>Bounding box regression -</p> <p>The next step is to determine the bounding boxes which correspond to rectangles highlighting all the objects in the image. We can have as many bounding boxes as there are objects within a given image.</p> <p>YOLO determines the attributes of these bounding boxes using a single regression module in the following format, where Y is the final vector representation for each bounding box.</p> \[Y = [pc, bx, by, bh, bw, c1, c2]\] <p>where \(pc\) is the probability score of the grid containing the object. \(c1, c2\) correspond to the object classes - ball and player.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intersection Over Unions or IOU for short</p> <p>Most of the time, a single object in an image can have multiple grid box candidates for prediction, even though not all of them are relevant. The goal of the IOU (a value between 0 and 1) is to discard such grid boxes to only keep those that are relevant. Here is the logic behind it:</p> <ul> <li>The user defines its IOU selection threshold, which can be, for instance, 0.5.</li> <li>Then YOLO computes the IOU of each grid cell which is the Intersection area divided by the Union Area.</li> <li>Finally, it ignores the prediction of the grid cells having an IOU ≤ threshold and considers those with an IOU &gt; threshold.</li> </ul> <p><img src="/assets/img/Object%20Detection/Untitled%202.png" alt="Untitled"/></p> </li> <li> <p>Non-Maximum Suppression.</p> <p>Setting a threshold for the IOU is not always enough because an object can have multiple boxes with IOU beyond the threshold, and leaving all those boxes might include noise. Here is where we can use NMS to keep only the boxes with the highest probability score of detection.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Although YOLO was state-of-the-art when it released, with much faster detection, it had a few disadvantages. It is unable to detect smaller objects within a grid as each grid is designed for single object detection. It is unable to detect new or unusual shapes, and the same loss function is used for both small and large bounding boxes which creates incorrect localizations.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Object%20Detection/Untitled%203.png" alt="Untitled"/></p> <p><strong>YOLOv2</strong> improvised over the existing architecture using <strong><a href="https://paperswithcode.com/method/darknet-19">Darknet-19</a></strong> as new architecture (Darknet is an open-source neural network framework in C and CUDA),</p> <ul> <li>batch normalization - reduced overfitting using a regularization effect.</li> <li>higher resolution of inputs,</li> <li>convolution layers with anchors - Replaces fully connected laters with anchor boxes to prevented predicting the exact coordinate of bounding boxes. Recall improved, accuracy decreased. Anchor boxes are predefined grids with certain aspect ratios spatially located in an image. These boxes are checked for an object probability score and are selected accordingly.</li> <li>dimensionality clustering - The previously mentioned anchor boxes are automatically found by YOLOv2 using k-means dimensionality clustering with k=5 instead of performing a manual selection. This novel approach provided a good tradeoff between the recall and the precision of the model.</li> <li>Fine-grained features - YOLOv2 predictions generate 13x13 feature maps, which is of course enough for large object detection. But for much finer objects detection, the architecture can be modified by turning the 26 × 26 × 512 feature map into a 13 × 13 × 2048 feature map, concatenated with the original features.</li> </ul> <p><strong>YOLOv3</strong> is an incremental improvement using Darknet-53 instead of Darknet-19. <strong>YOLOv4</strong> is an optimized for parallel computations. This architecture, compared to YOLOv3, adds the following information for better object detection:</p> <ul> <li>Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) block significantly increases the receptive field, segregates the most relevant context features, and does not affect the network speed.</li> <li>Instead of the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) used in YOLOv3, YOLOv4 uses <strong><a href="https://bio-protocol.org/exchange/minidetail?type=30&amp;id=9907669">PANet</a></strong> for parameter aggregation from different detection levels.</li> <li>Data augmentation uses the mosaic technique that combines four training images in addition to a self-adversarial training approach.</li> <li>Perform optimal hyper-parameter selection using genetic algorithms.</li> </ul> <p><strong>YOLOR</strong> is based on the unified network which is a combination of explicit and implicit knowledge approaches - (1) feature alignment, (2) prediction alignment for object detection, and (3) canonical representation for multi-task learning.</p> <p>Then, <strong>YOLOX</strong>, using a modified version of YOLOv3, decoupled classification and localization increasing the performance of the model. <a href="https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/yolox-explanation-mosaic-and-mixup-for-data-augmentation-3839465a3adf">Mosaic and MixUp data augmentation approaches</a> were added. Removed the anchor-based system that used to perform clustering under the hood. Introduced SimOTA instead of IoU.</p> <p><strong>YOLOv5</strong> uses Pytorch rather than Darknet, and has 5 different model sizes. <strong>YOLOv6</strong> was developed for industrial applications and introduced three improvements - a hardware-friendly backbone and neck design, an efficient decoupled head, and a more effective training strategy.</p> <p><strong>YOLOv7</strong> - <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.02696.pdf">Trained bag-of-freebies sets new state-of-the-art for real-time object detectors</a>.</strong> It reformed the architecture by integrating Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (E-ELAN) which allows the model to learn more diverse features for better learning. The term <strong>bag-of-freebies</strong> refers to improving the model’s accuracy without increasing the training cost, and this is the reason why YOLOv7 increased not only the inference speed but also the detection accuracy.</p> <h3 id="r-cnn---region-based-convolutional-neural-networks">R-CNN - Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks</h3> <p><strong>R-CNN</strong> models first select several proposed regions from an image (for example, anchor boxes are one type of selection method) and then label their categories and bounding boxes (e.g., offsets). These labels are created based on predefined classes given to the program. They then use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform forward computation to extract features from each proposed area.</p> <p>In 2015, <strong>Fast R-CNN</strong> was developed to significantly cut down train time. While the original R-CNN independently computed the neural network features on each of as many as two thousand regions of interest, Fast R-CNN runs the neural network once on the whole image. This is very comparable to YOLO’s architecture, but YOLO remains a faster alternative to Fast R-CNN because of the simplicity of the code.</p> <p>At the end of the network is a novel method known as Region of Interest (ROI) Pooling, which slices out each Region of Interest from the network’s output tensor, reshapes, and classifies it (Image Classification). This makes Fast R-CNN more accurate than the original R-CNN.</p> <p><strong>Mask R-CNN</strong> is an advancement of Fast R-CNN. The difference between the two is that Mask R-CNN added a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN; it can run at 5 fps.</p> <h3 id="other-approaches">Other Approaches</h3> <p><strong>SqueezeDet</strong> was specifically developed for autonomous driving, where it performs object detection using computer vision techniques. Like YOLO, it is a single-shot detector algorithm. In SqueezeDet, convolutional layers are used only to extract feature maps but also as the output layer to compute bounding boxes and class probabilities. The detection pipeline of SqueezeDet models only contains single forward passes of neural networks, allowing them to be extremely fast.</p> <p><strong>MobileNet</strong> is a single-shot multi-box detection network used to run object detection tasks. This model is implemented using the Caffe framework.</p> <h3 id="references">References</h3> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/blog/yolo-object-detection-explained">Datacamp YOLO</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-convolutional-neural-networks">Stanford CNNs</a> - Good site</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://viso.ai/deep-learning/yolov7-guide/">Viso AI YOLOv7</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://viso.ai/deep-learning/object-detection/">Viso AI Object Detection</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://viso.ai/computer-vision/what-is-computer-vision/">Viso AI Computer Vision</a></p> </li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Research"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A brief survey of object detection methods in 2023.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Numerical Analysis Notes</title><link href="https://sudhansh6.github.io/blog/NumAn/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Numerical Analysis Notes"/><published>2022-01-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sudhansh6.github.io/blog/NumAn</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sudhansh6.github.io/blog/NumAn/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="lecture-1">Lecture 1</h1> <p><em>Numerical Analysis</em> is the study of various methods</p> <ul> <li>to solve <ul> <li>differential equations,</li> <li>systems of linear equations,</li> <li>\(f(x) = \alpha\).</li> </ul> </li> <li>to approximate functions and</li> <li>to study the corresponding errors.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Example.</strong> \(e = \lim_{n \to \inf} (1 + 1/n)^n)\). How do we approximate \(e\) to an arbitrary accuracy? Since, the \(exp\) function is infinitely many times differentiable, we can approximate the function using Taylor’s theorem to any degree of precision we want.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> $$ \text{Taylor's theorem} \\ f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \cdots + \\ \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x - a)^k + \frac{f^{(k + 1)}(c)}{k!}(x - a)^{k + 1} $$ </div> <p>Using this, we get</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> $$ e = 1 + \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} + \cdots + \\ \frac{1}{n!} + \frac{e^c}{(n + 1)!} $$ </div> <p>where \(c\) is some real number between 0 and 1. Here, the error term at the \(n\)-th approximation is the term \(e^c/(n + 1)!\). We know that \(e^c\) is less than 3 so we can compute \(n\) where the error term is less than the prescribed error!</p> <p>For example, suppose we want the error to be less than \(10^{-10}\), then we use \(e^c/(n + 1)! &lt; 10^{-10}\).</p> <p><strong>Note.</strong> The last term is not the error in our approximation! We are choosing \(e^c = 3\) for no particular reason. It can be any value greater than the true value of \(e^c\). For instance, we can take \(e^c = 1000\) too. If we want our calculated value \(e\) value to be precise till the 10th decimal, then we ensure that \(1000/(n + 1)! &lt; 10^{-10}\) by tuning \(n\) appropriately.</p> <h2 id="aspects-of-numerical-analysis">Aspects of numerical analysis</h2> <ul> <li>The theory behind the calculation, and</li> <li>The computation.</li> </ul> <p>Some calculators have a loss of information due to limits in precision. This is due to the round-off error. We need to be able to detect and deal with such cases.</p> <h1 id="lecture-2">Lecture 2</h1> <h2 id="finite-digit-arithmetic">Finite digit arithmetic</h2> <p>When we do arithmetic, we allow for infinitely many digits. However, in the computational world, each representable number has only a fixed and finite number of digits. In most cases, the machine arithmetic is satisfactory, but at times problems arise because of this discrepancy. The error that is produced due to this issue is called the <strong>round-off</strong> error.</p> <p>A 64-bit representation is used for a real number. The first bit is a <strong>sign indicator</strong>, denoted by <em>s</em>. This is followed by an 11-bit exponent, <em>c</em>, called the <strong>characteristic</strong>, and a 52-bit binary fraction, <em>f</em>, called the <strong>mantissa</strong>. To ensure that numbers with small magnitude are equally representable, 1023 is subtracted from the characteristic, so the range of the exponent is actually from -1023 to 1024.</p> <p>Thus, the system gives a floating-point number of the form</p> <div style="text-align:center;"> $$ (-1)^s\cdot2^{c - 1023}\cdot(1 + f) $$ </div> <p>Since 52 binary digits correspond to between 16 and 17 decimal digits, we can assume that a number represented in this system is accurate till the 16th decimal.</p> <blockquote> <p>Can’t a single number be represented in many ways through this representation? Think about 1 for instance.</p> </blockquote> <p>The smallest positive number that can be represented is with \(s = 0, c = 1, f = 0\), so it is</p> <div style="text-align:center;"> $$ 2^{-1022}\cdot(1 + 0) \approx 0.22251 \times 10^{-307} $$ </div> <p>Numbers occurring in calculations that have a magnitude less than this number result in <strong>underflow</strong> and are generally set to 0.</p> <p>The largest positive number is</p> <div style="text-align:center;"> $$ 2^{1023}\cdot (2 - 2^{-52}) $$ </div> <p>Numbers above this would result in an <strong>overflow</strong>.</p> <h2 id="floating-point-representation">Floating-point representation</h2> <p>We will use numbers of the form</p> <div style="text-align:center;"> $$ \pm 0.d_1d_2\dots d_kd_{k + 1} \times 10^n $$ </div> <p>with \(1 \leq d_1 \leq 9\). There are two ways to get the floating-point representations \(fl(p)\) of a positive number \(p\)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Chopping.</strong> We simply chop off the \(d_{k + 1}, d_{k + 2}, \dots\) and write \(0.d_1d_2\dots d_k \times 10^n\)</li> <li><strong>Rounding.</strong> We add \(5 \times 10^{n - (k + 1)}\) to the number and then chop the result to obtain \(0.\delta_1\delta_2\dots \delta_k \times 10^n\)</li> </ul> <h2 id="errors">Errors</h2> <p>This approximate way of writing numbers is bound to create errors. If \(p\) is a real number and if \(p^*\) is its approximation then the <strong>absolute error</strong> is \(\|p - p ^*\|\) while the <strong>relative error</strong> is \(\|p - p ^*\|/p\) whenever \(p \neq 0\). Relative error is more meaningful as it takes into account the size of the number \(p\).</p> <p><strong>Note.</strong> Relative error can be negative as we take the value of \(p\) in the denominator!</p> <h2 id="significant-digits">Significant digits</h2> <p>We say that the number \(p^*\) approximates \(p\) to \(t\) significant digits if \(t\) is the largest non-negative integer for which</p> <div style="text-align:center;"> $$ \frac{\|p - p^*\|}{p} &lt; 5 \times 10^{-t} $$ </div> <h2 id="finite-digit-arithmetic-1">Finite Digit Arithmetic</h2> <p>The arithmetic in machines in defined by the following -</p> <div style="text-align:center;"> $$ x \oplus y := fl(fl(x) + fl(y)) $$ </div> <h1 id="lecture-3">Lecture 3</h1> <h2 id="major-sources-of-errors">Major sources of errors</h2> <p>One of the major sources of errors is cancellation of two nearly equal numbers. Suppose we have</p> <div style="text-align:center"> $$ fl(x) = 0.d_1d_2\dots d_p\alpha_{p + 1}\dots\alpha_k \times 10^n \\ fl(y) = 0.d_1d_2\dots d_p\beta_{p + 1}\dots\beta_k \times 10^n \\ fl(fl(x) - fl(y)) = 0.\gamma_{p + 1}\dots\gamma_k \times 10^{n - p} $$ </div> <p>In the above set of equations, the difference \(x \ominus y\) has \(k - p\) digits of significance compared to the \(k\) digits of significance of \(x\) and \(y\). The number of significant digits have reduced which leads to errors in further calculations.</p> <p>Another way the errors creep in is when we divide by number of small magnitude or multiply by numbers of large magnitude. This is because the error gets multiplied by a factor which increases its absolute value.</p> <p>Consider the expression \(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}/2a\). By default, we consider positive square roots. Here, if \(b^2\) is large compared to \(4ac\) then the machine is likely to treat \(4ac\) as zero. How do we get around this error? <strong>Rationalization</strong></p> <div style="text-align:center"> $$ \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \times \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}} = \frac{-2c}{b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}} $$ </div> <p>​ Notice what happened here. Previously, the roots would have become zero because \(4ac\) could have been approximated as zero. However, this does not happen after rationalization! Also, do note that this won’t work when \(b&lt;0\) as we are considering positive square roots. If \(b&lt;0\), we can use the formula without rationalization. Think about the other root using such cases. Thus, the cancellation error can come in two major ways:</p> <ul> <li>when we cancel two nearly equal numbers, and</li> <li>when we subtract a small number from a big number</li> </ul> <h3 id="errors-propagate">Errors propagate</h3> <p>Once an error is introduced in a calculation, any further operation is likely to contain the same or a higher error.</p> <h2 id="can-we-avoid-errors">Can we avoid errors?</h2> <p>Errors are inevitable in finite arithmetic. There are some measures that we can take to try to avoid errors, or minimize them. For example, a general degree 3 polynomial can be written as a nested polynomial.</p> <div style="text-align:center"> $$ ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d - x(x(ax + b) + c) + d $$ </div> <p>Computations done using this form will typically have a smaller error as the number of operations has reduced (from 5 to 3). Now, we are done with the first theme of our course - <strong><em>Machine arithmetic</em></strong>.</p> <h1 id="lecture-4">Lecture 4</h1> <h2 id="roots-of-equations">Roots of equations</h2> <p>The zeros of a function can give us a lot of information regarding the function. Why specifically zero? Division is in general more difficult to implement in comparison to multiplication. Division is implemented via the solution to roots of an equation in computers. There are other reasons such as eigenvalue decomposition. We shall see all of this later in the course.</p> <p><strong><em>Theorem.</em></strong> <em>Intermediate Value Theorem</em>. If \(f: [a, b] \to \mathbb R\) is a continuous function with \(f(a)\cdot f(b) &lt; 0\) then there is a \(c \in [a, b]\) such that \(f(x) = 0\).</p> <h3 id="bisection-method">Bisection method</h3> <p>The bisection method is implemented using the above theorem. To begin, we set \(a_1 = a\) and \(b_1 = b\), and let \(p_1\) be the midpoint of \([a, b]\);</p> <ul> <li>If \(f(p_1) = 0\), then we are done</li> <li>If \(f(p_1)f(a_1)&gt;0\), then the subinterval \([p_1, b_1]\) contains a root of \(f\), we then set \(a_2 = p_1\) and \(b_2 = b_1\)</li> <li>If \(f(p_1)f(b_1)&gt;0\), then the subinterval \([a_1, p_1]\) contains a root of \(f\), we then set \(a_2 = a_1\) and \(b_2 = p_1\)</li> </ul> <p>We continue this process until we obtain the root. Each iteration reduces the size of the interval by half. Therefore, it is beneficial to choose a small interval in the beginning. The sequence of \(\{p_i\}\) is a Cauchy sequence. IT may happen that none of the \(p_i\) is a root. For instance, the root may be an irrational number and \(a_1, b_1\) may be rational numbers. There are three criteria to decide to stop the bisection process.</p> <ul> <li>\(\|f(p_n)\| &lt; \epsilon\) - not very good because it may take a long time to achieve it, or that it may be achieved easily and yet \(p_n\) is significantly many steps away from a root of \(f\)</li> <li>\(\|p_n - p_{n-1}\| &lt;\epsilon\) is not good because it does not take the function \(f\) into account. While \(p_n\) and \(p_{n-1}\) may be close enough but the actual root may still be many steps away.</li> <li>\(p_n \neq 0 \text{ and } \frac{\|p_n - p_{n-1}\|}{\|p_n\|} &lt; \epsilon\) looks enticing as it mimics the relative error but again it does not take \(f\) into account.</li> </ul> <p>The bisection method has significant drawbacks - It is relatively slow to converge, and a good intermediate approximation might be inadvertently discarded. However, the method has the important property that is always converges to a solution.</p> <h1 id="lecture-5">Lecture 5</h1> <h2 id="fixed-points-and-roots">Fixed points and roots</h2> <p>A <em>fixed point</em> of \(f : [a,b] \to \mathbb R\) is \(p \in [a,b]\) such that \(f(p) = p\). Finding a fixed point of the function \(f\) is equivalent to finding the root of the function \(g(x) = f(x) - x\). We can create many such functions which give fixed points of \(f\) on solving for the roots of the function.</p> <p><strong><em>Theorem.</em></strong> <em>Fixed Point Theorem</em>. If \(f: [a,b] \to [a,b]\) is continuous then \(f\) has a fixed point. If, in addition, \(f’(x)\) exists on \((a, b)\) and \(\vert f’(x)\vert \leq k &lt; 1\) for all \(x \in (a, b)\) then \(f\) has a unique fixed point in \([a, b]\).</p> <p>The hypothesis is sufficient but not necessary!</p> <h3 id="fixed-point-iteration">Fixed point iteration</h3> <p>We start with a continuous \(f: [a,b] \to [a,b]\). Take any initial approximation \(p_0 \in [a,b]\) and generate a sequence \(p_n = f(p_{n - 1})\). If the sequence \(\{p_n\}\) converges to \(p \in [a, b]\) then</p> <div style="text-align:center"> $$ \begin{align} f(p) &amp;= f(\lim_n p_n) \\ &amp;= \lim_n f(p_n) = \lim_n p_{n + 1}\\ &amp;= p \end{align} $$ </div> <p>This method is called the <em>fixed point iteration method</em>. It’s convergence is not guaranteed.</p> <p>For instance, consider the roots of the equation \(x^3 + 4x^2 - 10 = 0\). The following functions can be used to find the roots using the fixed points.</p> <div style="text-align:center"> $$ \begin{align} x &amp;= g_1(x) = x - (x^3 + 4x^2 - 10)\\ x &amp;= g_2(x) = (\frac{10}{x} - 4x)^{1/2} \\ x &amp;= g_3(x) = \frac{1}{2}(10 - x^3)^{1/2} \end{align} $$ </div> <p>The results using different \(g\)’s in the Fixed Point Iteration method are surprising. The first two functions diverge, and the last one converges. This problem is because the hypothesis of the FPT does not hold in the first two functions. While the derivative \(g’(x)\) fails to satisfy in the FPT, a closer look tells us that it is enough to work on the interval \([1, 1.5]\) where the function \(g_3\) is strictly decreasing.</p> <p>So now we have the question - How can we find a fixed point problem that produces a sequence that reliably and rapidly converges to a solution to a given root-finding problem?</p> <h1 id="lecture-6">Lecture 6</h1> <h2 id="newton-raphson-method">Newton-Raphson method</h2> <p>This is a particular fixed point iteration method. Assume that \(f: [a, b] \to \mathbb R\) is twice differentiable. Let \(p \in [a, b]\) be a solution of the equation \(f(x) = 0\). If \(p_0\) is another point in \([a, b]\) then Taylor’s theorem gives</p> \[\begin{align} 0 &amp;= f(p) \\ &amp;= f(p_0) + (p - p_0)f'(p_0) + \frac{(p - p_0)^2}{2}f''(\xi) \end{align}\] <p>for some \(\xi\) between \(p\) and \(p_0\). We assume that \(\vert p - p_0 \vert\) is very small. Therefore, \(0 \approx f(p_0) + (p - p_0)f’(p_0)\). This sets the stage for the Newton-Raphson method, which starts with an initial approximation \(p_0\) and generate the sequence \(\{p_n\}\) by</p> \[p_n = p_{n - 1} - \frac{f(p_{n - 1})}{f'(p_{n - 1})}\] <p>What is the geometric interpretation of this method? It approximates successive tangents. The Newton-Raphson method is evidently better than the fixed point iteration method. However, it is important to note that \(\vert p - p_0 \vert\) is need to be small so the third term in the Taylor’s polynomial can be dropped.</p> <p><strong><em>Theorem.</em></strong> Let \(f: [a, b] \to \mathbb R\) be twice differentiable. If \(p \in (a, b)\) is such that \(f(p) = 0\) and \(f’(p) \neq 0\), then there exists a \(\delta &gt; 0\) such that for any \(p_0 \in [p - \delta, p + \delta]\), the Newton-Raphson method generates a sequence \(\{p_n\}\) converging to \(p\).</p> <p>This theorem is seldom applied in practice, as it does not tell us how to determine the constant \(\delta\). In a practical application, an initial approximation is selected and successive approximations are generated by the method. These will generally either converge quickly to the root, or it will be clear that convergence is unlikely.</p> <h1 id="lecture-7">Lecture 7</h1> <h3 id="problems-with-the-newton-raphson-method">Problems with the Newton-Raphson method</h3> <p>We have</p> \[p_n = p_{n - 1} - \frac{f(p_{n - 1})}{f'(p_{n - 1})}\] <p>One major problem with this is that we need to compute the value of \(f’\) at each step. Typically, \(f'\) is far more difficult to compute and needs more arithmetic operations to calculate than \(f\).</p> <h2 id="secant-method">Secant method</h2> <p>This method is a slight variation to NR to circumvent the above problem. By definition,</p> \[f'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(a) - f(x)}{a - x}\] <p>If we assume that \(p_{n - 2}\) is reasonable close to \(p_{n - 1}\) then</p> \[f'(p_{n - 1}) \approx \frac{f(p_{n - 1}) - f(p_{n - 2})}{p_{n - 1} - p_{n - 2}}\] <p>This adjustment is called as the <em>secant method</em>. The geometric interpretation is that we use successive secants instead of tangents. Note that we can use the values of \(f(p_{n - 2})\) from the previous calculations to prevent redundant steps. We need two initial guesses in this method.</p> <p>Secant method is efficient in comparison to Newton-Raphson as it requires only a single calculation in each iteration whereas NR requires 2 calculations in each step.</p> <h2 id="the-method-of-false-position">The method of false position</h2> <p>The NR or the Secant method may give successive approximations which are on one side of the root. That is \(f(p_{n - 1}) \cdot f(p_n)\) need not be negative. We can modify this by taking the pair of approximations which are on both sides of the root.

We get \(\tau_{i + 1}(h) \approx \frac 1 h (y(t_{i + 1}) - w_{i + 1})\) assuming \(y_i \approx w_i\). For \(n\)th degree truncation error, we get \(\tau_{i + 1}(h) \approx \frac 1 h (w^{n + 1}_{i + 1} - w^{n}_{i + 1})\).

For the function \(\phi\) satisfying Lipschitz condition with a \(h_0\), the one-step difference method <strong>is convergent iff it is consistent</strong>.

Adams-* methods are stable.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong><em>Numerical Linear Algebra</em></strong> - Basics - \(Ax = b\) has a unique solution iff \(A\) is invertible, and it does not have a unique or has no solution otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Cramer’s rule</strong> - \(x_j = \frac{\det A_j}{\det A}\). However, this is cumbersome. Determinant of an upper triangular matrix is product of the diagonal entries.</p> <p><strong>Gaussian Elimination Method</strong> - \(A = LU\) for most matrices \(A\). \(L\) is a lower triangular matrix and \(U\) is an upper triangular matrix. Form the augmented matrix \([ A \mid b]\). Linear combination of rows and swapping of rows can be performed. What is the total number of arithmetic operations?</p> <p>For converting to triangular - We use \((n - i)\) divisions for each row and \((n - i + 1)\) multiplications for each column of each row. Also, we have \((n - i)(n - i + 1)\) subtractions. In total, we have \((n - i)(n - i + 2)\) multiplications. Summing, we get \(\mathcal O(n^3)\) multiplications (\((2n^3 + 3n^2 - 5n)/6\)) and subtractions \(((n^3 - n)/3)\).</p> <p>For back substitution - multiplication is \((n^2 + n)/2\) and subtraction is \((n^2 - n)/2\).</p> </li> <li> <p>We have not considered finite digit arithmetic for GEM previously. The error dominates the solution when the pivot has a low absolute value. In general, we need to ensure that the pivot does not have very low magnitude by interchanging rows (followed by interchanging columns for triangular form if needed) - <strong>partial pivoting</strong>. However, this might not be enough to get rid of the rounding error. Therefore, we need to consider <strong>scaled partial pivoting</strong>. Define \(s_i\) as the maximum magnitude in the \(i\)th row. Now, the first pivot is chosen by taking the row with the maximum value of \(a_{i1}/s_i\). The operation count order still remains the same. You need not calculate scale factors more than once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>LU Decomposition</strong> - The conversion of \(A\) to a triangular form using the above method can be represented as a sequence of matrix multiplications (if \(A\) does not require any row interchanges). The inverse of a matrix depicting operations on \(A\) can be seen a matrix depicting the same inverse operations on \(A\). In the end, we get \(A = (L^{(1)} \dots L^{(n - 1)})(M^{(1)}\dots M^{(n-1)}A)\) where each \(M^{(i)}\) represents the action that uses \(A_{ii}\) as a pivot. Once we get \(L\) and \(U\), we can solve \(y = Ux\) and \(Ly = b\) separately. There are multiple decompositions possible which are eliminated by imposing conditions on the triangular matrices. One such condition is setting \(L_{ii} = U_{ii}\) which is known as <em>Cholesky Decomposition</em>.</p> <p>We had assumed that row interchanges are not allowed. However, we can build <strong>permutation matrices</strong> for row interchanges which will be of the form of an identity matrix with row permutations.</p> <p>Therefore, we get <strong>PLU decomposition</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Diagonally dominant matrices</strong> - An \(n \times n\) matrix \(A\) is said to be diagonally dominant when \(\mid a_{ii} \mid \geq \sum^n \mid a_{ij} \mid\) for all rows. <u>A strongly diagonally dominant matrix is invertible</u>. Such matrices will not need row interchanges, and the computations will be stable wrt the round off errors.</p> <blockquote> <p>Why this instead of \(\mid a_{ii} \mid \geq \max \mid a_{ij} \mid\)</p> </blockquote> <p>A matrix \(A\) is <strong>positive definite</strong> if \(x^tAx &gt; 0\) for every \(x \neq 0\). We shall also consider \(A\) to be symmetric in the definition. Every positive definite matrix is invertible, \(A_{ii} &gt; 0\) for each \(i\), \((A_{ij})^2 &lt; A_{ii}A_{jj}\), and \(\max_{1\leq k, j \leq n} \mid A_{kj} \mid \leq \max_{1 \leq i \leq n}\mid A_{ii}\mid\).</p> <p>A <strong>leading principal submatrix</strong> of matrix \(A\) is the top-left \(k \times k\) submatrix of \(A\). \(A\) <u>is positive definite iff each leading principal submatrix of</u> \(A\) <u> has a positive determinant.</u></p> <p>Gaussian Elimination on a symmetric matrix can be applied without interchanging columns iff the matrix is positive definite.</p> <p>A matrix \(A\) is positive definite iff \(A = LDL^t\) where \(L\) is lower triangular with 1’s on the diagonal and \(D\) is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries. Alternatively, \(A\) is positive dfinite iff \(A = LL^t\) where \(L\) is a lower triangular matrix. <strong>Note.</strong> Positive definite is stronger than Cholesky decomposition.</p> </li> <li> <p>We have been seeing direct methods for solving \(Ax = b\). We shall see some iterative methods now. We need a distance metric to check the closeness of the approximation. We will consider \(l_2\) distance = \(\| x - y\|_2 = \left( \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 \right)^{1/2}\) and \(l_\infty\) distance = \(\| x - y\|_2 = \max_{i = 1}^n \mid x_i - y_i \mid\). Also, \(\|x - y\|_\infty \leq \|x - y\|_2 \leq \sqrt n\|x - y\|_\infty\). We also need to consider distances in matrices.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Distances in Matrices</strong> - \(\|A\|_2 = \max_{\|x\|_2 = 1} \|Ax\|_2\) and \(\|A\|_\infty = \max_{\|x\|_\infty = 1} \|Ax\|_\infty\). The \(l_\infty\) can be directly calculated using \(\|A\|_\infty = ]max_{i} \sum_j \mid A_{ij} \mid\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>eigenvalues, eigenvectors</strong> - A <strong>non-zero</strong> vector \(v \in \mathbb R^n\) is an eigenvector for \(A\) if there is a \(\lambda \in \mathbb R\) such that \(Av = \lambda v\) and \(\lambda \in \mathbb R\) is the eigenvalue. The <strong>characteristic polynomial</strong> of \(A\) is \(\det(A - \lambda I)\). We do not consider the complex roots that are not real for these polynomials to calculate eigenvalues.</p> <p><strong>Spectral radius</strong> - \(\rho(A) = \max \mid \lambda \mid\). Then, we have the relation that \(\|A\|_2 = [\rho(A^tA)]^{1/2}\) and also \(\rho(A) \leq \|A\|_2\) and \(\rho(A) \leq \|A\|_\infty\).</p> <p><strong>Convergent matrices</strong> - It is of particular importance to know when powers of a matrix become small, that is, when all the entries approach zero. An \(n \times n\) matrix \(A\) is called convergent if for each \(1 \leq i, j \leq n\), \(\lim_{k \to \infty}(A^k)_{ij} = 0\).</p> <ul> <li>\(A\) is a convergent matrix</li> <li> \[\lim_{n \to \infty} \|A^n\|_2 = 0\] </li> <li> \[\lim_{n \to \infty} \|A^n\|_\infty = 0\] </li> <li> \[\rho(A) &lt; 1\] </li> <li>\(\lim_{n \to \infty} A^nv =0\) for every vector \(v\).</li> </ul> <p>The above statements are all equivalent.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iterative techniques are not often used for smaller dimensions. We will study <strong>Jacobi</strong> and the <strong>Gauss-Seidel</strong> method.</p> <p><strong>Jacobi Method</strong> - We assume that \(\det(A)\) being non-zero (as matrix must be invertible for solution) and the diagonal entries of \(A\) are also non-zero. We have</p> <p>Jacobi suggested that we start with an initial vector \(x^{(0)} = [x_1^{(0)}, \dots, x_n^{(0)}]\) and for \(k \geq 1\)</p> \[x_i^{(k)} = \frac{b_i - \sum_{j \neq i} a_{ij}x_j^{(k - 1)}}{a_{ii}}\] <p>The error in the iterations is given by</p> \[\mid x_i - x_i^{(k)} \mid \leq (\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{a_{ij}}{a_{ii}})\|x_j - x_j^{(k - 1)}\|_\infty\] <p>which gives</p> \[\| x - x^{(k)} \|_\infty \leq (\max_i \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{a_{ij}}{a_{ii}})\|x_j - x_j^{(k - 1)}\|_\infty\] <p>If \(\mu = \max{i}\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{a_{ij}}{a_{ii}} &lt; 1\), then convergence is guaranteed. If \(\mu &lt; 1\), then the condition is nothing but that of strictly diagonally dominant matrices.</p> <p><strong>Gauss-Seidel method</strong> - The idea is that once we have improved one component, we use it to improve the component of the next component and so on.</p> \[x_i^{(k)} = \frac{1}{a_{ii}} \left[b_i - \sum_{j = 1}^{i - 1}a_{ij}x_j^{(k)} - \sum_{j = i + 1}^n a_{ij}x_j^{(k - 1)}\right]\] <p>There are linear systems where Jacobi method converges but Gauss-Seidel method does not converge. If \(A\) is strictly diagonally dominant, then both methods converge to the true solution.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Residual vector</strong> - If \(\tilde x\) is an approximation to \(Ax = b\), then \(r = b - A\tilde x\) is the residual vector. However, it is not always true that when \(\|r \|\) is small then \(\|x - \tilde x\|\) is also small. This is because \(r = A(x - \tilde x)\), and that represents the affine transformation of space. This phenomenon is captured as follows</p> <p>For a non-singular \(A\), we have</p> \[\|x - \tilde x\|_\infty \leq \|r \|_\infty \cdot \|A^{-1}\|_\infty\] <p>If \(x \neq 0\) and \(b \neq 0\)</p> \[\frac{\|x - \tilde x \|_\infty}{\|x\|_\infty} \leq \|A\|_\infty\cdot \|A^{-1}\|_\infty \cdot \frac{\|r\|_\infty}{\|b\|_\infty}\] <p>These relations work for \(l_2\) norm too.</p> <blockquote> <p>I think \(\|A\|_\infty \|x\|_\infty \geq \|b\|_\infty\)</p> </blockquote> <p>The <strong>condition number</strong> of a non-singular matrix \(A\) is</p> \[K(A) = \|A\|_\infty \cdot \|A^{-1}\|_\infty\] <p>Also, \(\|AA^{-1}\|_\infty \leq \|A\|_\infty \|A^{-1}\|_\infty\). A non-singular matrix \(A\) is said to be <strong>well-conditioned</strong> if \(K(A)\) is close to 1.</p> <p>However, the condition number depends on the round-off errors too. The effects of finite-digit arithmetic show up in the calculation of the inverse. As the calculation of inverse is tedious, we try to calculate the condition number without the inverse. If we consider \(t\)-digit arithmetic, we approximately have</p> \[\|r\|_\infty \approx 10^{-t}\|A\|_\infty \cdot \|\tilde x \|_\infty\] <p>One drawback is that we would have to calculate \(r\) is double precision due to the above relation. The approximation for \(K(A)\) comes from \(Ay = r\). Now, \(\tilde y \approx A^{-1}r = x - \tilde x\). Then,</p> \[\|\tilde y\| \leq \|A^{-1}\| \cdot (10^{-t}\cdot \|A\| \|\tilde x\|)\] <p>Using the above expression, we get</p> \[K(A) \approx \frac{\|\tilde y\|}{\|\tilde x\|}10^t\] <p>The only catch in the above method is that we need to calculate \(r\) in \(2t\)-finite arithmetic.</p> <p><strong>Iterative refinement</strong> - As we had defined \(\tilde y = x - \tilde x\), in general, \(\tilde x + \tilde y\) is more accurate. This is called as iterative improvement. If the process is applied using \(t\)-digit arithmetic and if \(K(A) \approx 10^q\), then after \(k\) iterations, we have approximately \(\min(t, k(t - q))\) correct digits. When \(q&gt; t\), increased precision must be used.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Approximations for eigenvalues</strong></p> <p><strong>Gerschgorin theorem</strong> - We define discs \(D_i = \left\{ z \in \mathbb C: \mid z - a_{ii} \mid \leq \sum_{j \neq i} \mid A_{ij} \mid \right\}\). Then, all eigenvalues of \(A\) are contained in the union of all the disks \(D_i\). The union of any \(k\) of the disk that do not intersect the remaining \(n - k\) disks contains precisely \(k\) of the eigenvalues including the multiplicity. From this theorem, we get that strictly diagonally dominant matrices are invertible. This is also true for strictly diagonally column dominant matrices.</p> <p>The above theorem provides us the initial approximations for the eigenvalues. We shall see the Power method.</p> <p><strong>Power method</strong> - We assume \(\mid \lambda_1 \mid &gt; \mid \lambda_2 \mid \geq \dots \geq \mid \lambda_n \mid\), and that \(A\) has \(n\) linearly independent eigenvectors. Choose a non-zero \(z \in V\), and compute</p> \[\lim_{k \to \infty} A^k z\] <p>to get the eigenvalue! (Think of vector space transformations geometrically).</p> <p>If \(z = \sum \alpha_i v_i\), we get</p> \[A^k z = \lambda^k_1 \alpha_1 v_1 + \dots + \lambda^k_n \alpha_n v_n = \lambda_1^k \alpha_1 v_1\] <p>for high values of \(k\).</p> <p>Sometimes, \(z\) may not have the component of \(v_1\). We choose a vector such that this is not the case.</p> <p>Sometimes, it may also be the case that</p> <p>\(\mid \lambda_1 \mid \geq \mid \lambda_2 \mid \geq \dots &gt; \mid \lambda_n \mid &gt; 0\). \(A\) is invertible iff this holds. Then, we use the power method on \(A^{-1}\).</p> <p>Sometimes, \(\mid \lambda_1 \mid &lt; 1\) and we’ll converge to 0. On the other hand, if it is more than 1, the limit will shoot to infinity. To take care of these, we scale \(A^k(z)\), so that it is finite and non-zero.</p> <p>Firstly, we choose \(z\) such that \(\|z^{(0)}\| = 1\) and we choose a component \(p_0\) of \(z^{(0)}\) such that \(\mid z_{p_0}^{(0)} \mid = 1\). Following this, we scale each subsequent value as follows - Let \(w^{(1)} = Az^{(0)}\) and \(\mu^{(1)} = w_{p_0}^{(1)}\).</p> \[\mu^{(1)} = \lambda_1 \frac{\alpha_1(v_1)_{p_0} + \dots + (\lambda_n/ \lambda_1) \alpha_n (v_n)_{p_0}}{\alpha_1(v_1)_{p_0} + \dots + \alpha_n (v_n)_{p_0}}\] <p>Now, we choose \(p_1\) to be the least integer with \(\mid w_{p_1}^{(1)}\mid = \|w^{(1)}\|\) and define \(z^{(1)}\) by</p> \[z^{(1)} = \frac{1}{w_{p_1}^{(1)}} Az^{(0)}\] <p>Then, in general,</p> \[\mu^{(m)} = w_{p_{m - 1}}^{(m)} = \lambda_1 \frac{\alpha_1(v_1)_{p_0} + \dots + (\lambda_n/ \lambda_1)^m \alpha_n (v_n)_{p_0}}{\alpha_1(v_1)_{p_0} + \dots + (\lambda_n/ \lambda_1)^{m - 1}\alpha_n (v_n)_{p_0}}\] <p>Now, \(\lim_{m \to \infty} \mu^{(m)} = \lambda_1\).</p> <p>To find other eigenvalues, we use <strong>Gram-Schmidt orthonormalisation</strong>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Numerical Analysis/image-20220415200748597.png" alt="image-20220415200748597"/></p> </li> </ul> <hr/> <h4 id="end-of-course">END OF COURSE</h4> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Notes"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A course disucssing interpolation theory, numerical intergration, numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations, numerical solutions to system of linear equations and roots of non-linear equations.]]></summary></entry></feed>
