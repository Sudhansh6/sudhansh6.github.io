The field has deep and attractive scientific problems, which have been advancing at a rapid pace in the past few years.<br> In the early days of research, the focus in vision was on engineering “good” features coupled with a optimisation algorithm or a shallow neural network. As the processors became more powerful, the emphasis shifted to end-to-end approaches with inclusion of self-supervision and multi-modal learning paradigms.</p> <p>It is often helpful to breakdown the perception tasks into known-algorithms. For example, in autonomous driving, the tasks include SLAM (visual, Structure from Motion), path planning (lane detection, obstacle detection, 3D localization), Semantic segmentation etc. Similarly, the tasks in augmented reality devices are gaze tracking, material and lighting estimation, head pose estimation, depth estimation, etc.</p> <p>Deep learning has opened new areas of research in vision. Features such as generation of high-quality content, end-to-end training, data-driven priors and highly parallelizable architectures have proven advantageous for many problems in computer vision. However, it is also important to note the limitations of these techniques -</p> <ul> <li>Large scale labeled data is not always available</li> <li>Lack of generalization to unseen domains</li> <li>Good at narrow “classification”, not at broad “reasoning”</li> <li>Lack of interpretability</li> <li>Lack of reliability, security or privacy guarantee</li> </ul> <p>To counter these problems, we typically couple our algorithms with self-supervision, physical modelling, multi-modal learning and <em>foundation models</em>. In the recent years, these techniques have been applied to various problems, and the following are arguably the biggest advances in Computer Vision -</p> <ul> <li>Vision Transformers</li> <li>Vision-Language Models</li> <li>Diffusion Models</li> <li>Neural Rendering</li> </ul> <p>These techniques show promise to solve keystone problems in augmented reality, interactive robotics, and autonomous driving. The course will cover the following these topics, along with other fundamentals required.</p> <blockquote> <p>Demonstrate code in presentation</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="neural-architectures">Neural Architectures</h3> <p>The motivation for an artificial neuron (perceptron), comes from a biological neuron where the output is linear combination of the inputs combined with a non-linear activation function. From here, we develop multi-layer networks which are again motivated from the Hubel and Weisel’s architecture in biological cells.</p> <h3 id="neural-networks">Neural Networks</h3> <p>The simplest neural network is a perceptron represented by \(\sigma (x) = \text{sign}(\sum_i w_i x_i + b)\) where the optimal weight values are obtained using an unconstrained optimization problem. These concepts can be extended for “Linear Regression” and “Logistic Regression” tasks.</p> <p>Non-linearity in neural networks is introduced through <strong>Activation functions</strong> such as</p> <ul> <li>Sigmoid - Have vanishing gradient issues</li> <li>tanh - Centered version of sigmoid</li> <li>ReLU - Simplest non-linear activation, with easy gradient calculation.</li> <li>ELU - Added to prevent passive neurons.</li> </ul> <p>At the <strong>output layer</strong>, we apply a final non-linear function is applied to calculate the <strong>loss</strong> in the predicted output. Typically for <strong>classification problems</strong>, <em>Softmax</em> function is used to map the network outputs to probabilities. One-hot representations are not differentiable, and are hence not used for this task. In image synthesis problems, the output layer usually has \(255*sigmoid(z)\).</p> <p><strong>Theorem (Universal function approximators)</strong>: A two-layer network with a sufficient number of neurons can approximate any continous function to any desired accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Width or Depth?</strong> A wider network needs more and more neurons to represent arbitrary function with high enough precision. A deeper network on the contrary, require few parameters needed to achieve a similar approximation power. However, “overly deep” plain nets do not perform well. This is due to the vanishing gradient problem, wherein we are not able to train deep networks with the typical optimization algorithms.</p> <h3 id="convolution-networks">Convolution Networks</h3> <p>The neural network architecture is modified for images using “learnable kernels” in convolutional neural networks. Each convolution layer consists of a set of kernels that produce feature maps from the input. These feature maps capture the <em>spatial</em> and <em>local</em> relationships in the input which is crucial for images.</p> <p>The <em>induction bias</em> in images is that neighbouring variables are locally correlated. An image need not be 2D, it can consist of multiple channels (RGB, hyperspectral, etc.), and convolutional layers work <em>across all</em> these channels to produce feature maps.</p> <p>In a classical neural network, each pixel in the input image would be connected to every neuron in the network layer leading to <em>many</em> parameters for a single image. Using kernels, we use <em>shared weights</em> across all pixel locations, and this greatly reduces the number of learnable parameters without losing much information.</p> <p>Convolution layers are generally accompanies with <strong>Pooling layers</strong> which do not have any learnable parameters, and are used to reduce the size of the output. These layers are invariant to small (spatial)transformations in the input and help observe a larger <em>receptive field</em> in the next layer. The latter property is important to observe hidden layers in the feature maps.</p> <p><strong>Receptive Field</strong> - It is the area in the input iamge “seen” by a unit in a CNN. Inits with deeper layers will have wider receptive fields whereas wider receptive fields allow more global reasoning across entire image. This way, the pooling leads to more rapid widening of receptive fields. We need \(\mathcal O(n/k)\) layers with \((k \times k)\) convolutional filters to have a receptive field of \(n\) in the input. <em>Dilation layers</em> are used to achieve the same receptive field with \(\mathcal O(\log n)\) layers.</p> <p>However, in practice, the empirical receptive fields in the deeper networks is lower than the theoretical value due to sparse weights.</p> <p>Convolution networks are augmented with <em>dense</em> layers to get the output, to learn from the feature maps.</p> <p>The vanishing gradient problem in deeper networks has been solved using <strong>skip connections</strong> wherein the features from the earlier layers are concatenated with the deeper ones to allow passage of information. This way, we provide the network with the original input allowing it to learn the smaller fluctuations in the input (rather than focusing on learning the input itself).</p> <p>In summary, the key operations in convolutional layers are</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Input image -&gt; Convlution -&gt; Non-linearity -&gt; Spatial Pooling -&gt; Feature Maps</code></p> <p>CNNs have the above set of operations repeated many times. CNNs have been successful due to the following reasons</p> <ul> <li>Good Abstractions - Hierarchical and expressive feature representations. Conventional image processing algorithms relied on a pyramidal representation of features, and this methodology has also paved its way in CNNs.</li> <li>Good inductive biases - Remarkable in transferring knowledge across tasks. That is, pretrained networks can be easily augmented with other general tasks.</li> <li>Ease of implementation - Can be trained end-to-end, rather than hand-crafted for each task, and they can easily be implemented on parallel architectures.</li> </ul> <p>The key ideas -</p> <ul> <li>Convolutional layers leverage the local connectivity and weight sharing to reduce the number of learnable parameters.</li> <li>Pooling layers allow larger receptive fields letting us capture global features.</li> <li>Smaller kernels limit the number of parameters without compromising the performance much. This design decision comes from preferring deeper networks over wider networks. For example, \((1 \times 1)\) kernels are reduce the dimension in the channels dimension.</li> <li>Skip connections allow easier optimization with greater depth.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Why are (1, 1) kernels useful? Use fewer channels instead?</p> </blockquote> <h1 id="transformers">Transformers</h1> <p>Transformers have shown better results in almost every task that CNNs have shone previously in. CNNs require significant depth or larger kernels to share information between non-local spatial locations (recall receptive fields).</p> <p>Many tasks, such as question-answering, require <em>long-range</em> reasoning and transformers are very good at this. For example, placing objects in augmented reality requires reasoning about light-sources, surface estimation, occlusion/shadow detection, etc. This is the primary intuition behind <strong>attention mechanism</strong> which is representative of foveated vision in humans.</p> <p><img src="../../assets/img/Computer%20Vision/2024-04-11-12-10-13-image.png" alt=""></p> <p><strong>Tokens</strong> - A data type than can be understood as a set of neurons obtained from vectorizing patches of an image. Typically need not be vectors, but they can be any structured froup that alows a set of differentiable operations. Note that these tokens in hidden layers might not correspond to pixels or interpretable attributes.</p> <p>The following captures a very good intuition for transformers.</p> <p><em>A transformers acts on tokens similarly as neural network acts on neurons. That is, combining tokens is same as for neurons, except tokens are vectors \(t_{out }= \sum_i w_i t_i\). In neural networks, linear layers are represented by \(x_{out} = W x_{in}\) and \(W\) is data-free, whereas in transformers, \(T_{out} = AT_{in}\), \(A\) depends on the data (attention). Again, non-linearity in neural networks is implemented via functions like ReLU whereas transformers use dense layers for non-linearity (applied token wise).</em></p> <p>The attention layer is a spsecial kind of linear transformation of tokens, wherein the attention function \(A = f(.)\) tells how much importance to pay to each token depending on the input query and other signals. <em>Attention-maps</em> help us visualize the global dependencies in the information. The required information is embedded in some dimension of the token representation. For example, the first dimension can count the number of horses in an iamge, and the bottom 3 dimensions can encode the color of the horse on the right. Attention has this flexibility to different allocations address different parts of a query. They can “attend” to only certain patches <em>which are important to the query</em>. This kind of functionality is difficult with CNNs.</p> <blockquote> <p>Apply embedding and neural network (before CNNs and Transofrmers)? Same number of parameters? Essentially similar thing? Associated higher weight to more related embedding.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="query-key-value-attention">Query-Key-Value Attention</h3> <p>The mechanisms described previously are implemented by projecting tokens into queries, keys and values. Each of these are a vector of dimensions $p$, where $p &lt; d$. The <strong>query</strong> vector for the question is used to weigh the <strong>key</strong> vector for each token to obtain the <strong>values</strong>. This is done via computing the similarity between query and each key, and then the <em>attention</em> is given by the extent of similarities, normalized with softmax. The output token is obtained by summing all value vectors with weights assigned from the previous calculations. Roughly, the process looks like -</p> \[\begin{align*} \left. \begin{align*} q = W_q t \\ K_i = W_k t_i \end{align*} \right\} \implies s_i = q^T k_i \\ a_i = softmax(s_i) \\ t_{out} = \sum a_i v_i \end{align*}\] <p>The purpose of “values” is to ‘project’ back the similarities between queries and keys to the ‘token space’.</p> <p>Also note that, if the patch-size is too large, then we might lose the information within the patches. This is a tradeoff, and the decision is made based on the task at hand. For example, classification may work with large patches but tasks such as segmentation may not.</p> <h4 id="self-attention">Self-Attention</h4> <p>How do we learn implicit representations that can work with general queries? We compute <em>self-attention</em> using the image tokens as the queries - information derived from the image itself. How does this process help us? For example, if we are performing instance segmentation of an image with horses. Then, the concept of ‘horse’ is learned by attending more to tother horse tokens and less to background. Similarly, ‘a particular instance’ is learned by attending less to the tokens from other horses. When we do this for all pairs across \(N\) tokens gives us an \(N \times N\) attention matrix.</p> <p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation.png" title="" alt="" width="307"></p> <p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png" title="" alt="" width="393"></p> <p>Typically, this matrix is computed in the <strong>encoder</strong> part of a transformer. This matrix is then used in the decoder with an input query to obtain the required results.</p> <h3 id="encoders">Encoders</h3> <p>An encoder of a transformer typically consists of many identical blocks connected serially with one another. Each such encoder block, computes a self-attention matrix and passes it through a feed-forward neural network, and they need to be applied across all the tokens in the input. Since the embeddings of tokens are independent of one another, each level of encoder blocks can be applied <em>in parallel</em> to all the tokens (patches in vision transformers) to obtain the embeddings. Such parallel computations were not possible in previous models like RNNs, which heavily relied on sequential dependencies.</p> <p>The original transformers paper normalizes the similarities with \(\sqrt{N}\) where \(N\) is the embedding dimension. This allows the gradients to stabilise and gives much better performance. This a simplified view of the mechanisms used in transformers.</p> <p>In addition to these, transformers also use <em>positional encoding</em> to encode the position of the tokens in the input sequence. In the context of images, is encodes where each patch occurs in the image.</p> <p><img src="C:\Users\ITSloaner\AppData\Roaming\marktext\images\2024-04-10-18-07-17-image.png" alt=""></p> <p>Positional encoding is usually done via sinusoidal functions. Other “learning-based” representations have been explored but they don’t have much different effect. This encoding structure allows extrapolation to sequnce lengths not seen in training.</p> <p>They also have <em>multi-head attention</em> which is equivalent to multiple channels in CNNs. That is, it allows patches to output more than one type of information.</p> <p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_multi-headed_self-attention-recap.png" alt=""></p> <p>This <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">blog</a> explains these mechanisms in-depth for interested readers. In summary, the functions of the encoder is visualized as</p> <p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png" alt=""></p> <h3 id="decoders">Decoders</h3> <p>A decoder block is similar to an encoder block, with auto-regressive . The attention values learned in Encoders are used as ‘keys’ in the decoder attention block. This is called as <em>cross attention</em>.</p> <h2 id="vision-transformers">Vision-Transformers</h2> <p>Vision transformers build on the same ideas used in a transformer. Typically, they use only the encoder part of the architecture where patches are extracted from images and are flattened to form the tokens for the attention mechanism. They are usually projected using a linear layer or a CNN before performing the calculations. Apart from this, vision transformers also include an additional <em>class token</em> in the embeddings to help learn the global information across the image.</p> <p>CNNs typically have better inductive bias whereas transformers excel in shorter learning paths for long-range reasoning. However, the cost of self-attention is quadratic in the image size. Also note that, if the patch-size is too large, then we might lose the information within the patches. This is a tradeoff, and the decision is made based on the task at hand. For example, classification may work with large patches but tasks such as segmentation may not.</p> <h3 id="swin-transformers-and-dense-prediction-transformers">Swin Transformers and Dense Prediction Transformers</h3> <p>The vanilla vision transformer is restricted to classification tasks and is not optimal for other tasks like detection and segmentation. Also, as we have noted before, the quadratic complexity limit the number of patches in the image. Some image processing pipelines extract features across different scales of an image whereas the vanilla transformer is restricted to the uniform (coarse) scale.</p> <p>To address these limitations, <strong>swin transformers</strong> bring two key ideas from CNNs</p> <ul> <li> <p>Multi-scale feature maps - Feature maps from one resolution are downsampled to match the size in the next block.</p> <p><img src="../../assets/imgs/2024-04-12-17-27-50-image.png" title="" alt="" data-align="left"></p> </li> <li> <p>Local connectivity -</p> <ul> <li> <p>Windowed self-attention - Limit the computations by considering a local window (this was actually left as future work in the original attention paper).</p> </li> <li> <p>Shifted window self-attention - Allows windowed self-attention to learn long-range features using “shifts”. Essentially, we move the patches around to bring farther patches close together.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>However, these modifications are not enough for tasks like segmentation. Instead, we use something called as a <em>dense prediction transformer</em> (<strong>DPTs</strong>) where we couple the transformer encoder with a convolutional decoder to upsample and predict the required output.</p> <blockquote> <p>CNNs are shift-invariant whereas ViTs are permutation invariant. Why?</p> </blockquote> <p><img src="../../assets/imgs/2024-04-12-17-36-33-image.png" alt=""></p> <p>At each scale level in the above picture, we <em>reassemble</em> the tokens by concatenating and convolving with appropriate kernels to recover image-like representations in the decoder layers.</p> <h3 id="multimodality">Multimodality</h3> <p>Transformers allowed for easy multi-modal representations by tokenizing data from each modality with its own variant of <em>patches</em>. Works such as VATT have explored merging audio waveforms, text and images.</p> <h1 id="generative-models">Generative Models</h1> <h2 id="discriminative-and-generative-models">Discriminative and Generative Models</h2> <p>In such models, a <em>discriminator model</em> tries to distinguish the output generated by a generated from a real input. The goal of the <em>generator</em> is to genereate a realistic sample from the input.</p> <p>Formally, disciminative models (classifiers) learn a many-to-one function \(f\) to learn labels for a given input. A generative model \(g\) maps these labels to the input space, and this function is one-to-many since one label can map to multiple inputs. It is difficult to model a stochastic function. Therefore, a generator model is coupled with a <em>noise vector</em> to construct a deterministic \(g\) with stochastic input \(z\). This variable \(z\) is called a <strong>latent variable</strong> since it is not observed in training data composed of \(\{x, y\}\) pairs.</p> \[\begin{align*} \text{Discriminative Models learn } P(Y \vert X) \\ \text{Generative Models learn } P(X, Y) \\ \text{Conditional Generator learn } P(X \vert Y) \\ \end{align*}\] <p>Let us focus on image generative models. Then, each dimension of the latent variable can encode the various characteristics of the image essentially allowing us to generate a wide variety of images. The labels \(y\) for images need not be classification labels, but textual descriptions can also be used for supervision.</p> <p>To understand how these models work, consider the case of uncoditional generative models. The goal is, given the real data \(x\), to generate synthetic data \(\hat x\) that <em>looks like</em> the real data. How do we quantify ‘looks like’?</p> <ul> <li> <p>We can try and match some marginal statistics - mean, variance, edge statistics, etc of the real data. Such measures are very useful in techniques for texture synthesis. For example, <a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/labs/heegerlab/content/publications/Heeger-siggraph95.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Heeger-Bergen texture synthesis [1995]</a> uses an iterative process starting from the Gaussian noise and matches intensity histograms across different scales. Such design choices are used in modern techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StyleGAN" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">StyleGANs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Diffusion models</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have a high probability of success under a model fit to real-data (A discriminator).</p> </li> </ul> <p>The key-challenge in these models is novelity in the generation to ensure generalization.</p> <h3 id="generative-models-1">Generative Models</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Density/Energy based models</strong>- Learn a scoring function \(s:X \to R\) that scores real-samples with a high score which represents energy/probability. During generation, return samples which have a high score. This paradigm is particularly useful for applications like anomaly detection.</p> <p>In these methods, we produce \(p_\theta\) fit to the training data by optimizing \(\arg\min_{p_\theta} D(p_{\theta}, p_{data})\). Since we don’t know \(p_{data}\) explicitly (we only have access to samples \(x \sim p_{data}\)), we minimize the <strong>KL-divergence</strong> to reduce the distance between the distributions using the samples.</p> \[\begin{align*} p_\theta^* &amp;= \arg\min_{p_\theta} KL(p_{data} \vert\vert p_\theta)\\ &amp;= \arg\max \mathbb E_{x\sim p_{data}}[\log p_\theta] - \mathbb E_{x\sim p_{data}}[\log p_{data}] \\ &amp;= \end{align*}\] <p>Intuitively, this way of optimization increases the density where the models are observed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sample from Noise</strong> - Learn a generative function \(g: Z \to X\) without needing to learn a probability density function. These methods explicitly model the data distribution, and techniques like GANs and Diffusion Models come under this regime.</p> </li> </ul> <h1 id="yolox">YOLOX</h1> <h1 id="dino">DINO</h1> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/philosophy/">Philosophy Notes</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/dbms/">DiBS Notes</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/automata/">Automata Notes</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/operating-systems/">Operating System Notes</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/programming/">Programming Cheatsheet</a> </li> </div> <script>document.querySelectorAll("#table-of-contents a").forEach(function(e){e.addEventListener("click",function(e){e.preventDefault();var t=this.getAttribute("href").substring(1);document.querySelectorAll(".content-section").forEach(function(e){e.classList.add("hidden")});var n=document.getElementById(t);n&&n.classList.remove("hidden")})});</script> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Sudhansh Peddabomma.
