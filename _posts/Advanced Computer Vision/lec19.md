## Contrastive Objectives

How are models like CLIP trained? 

- **Image-text matching loss** - Create similar and dissimilar sets of image-caption pairs, and the task becomes a binary classification problem

- **Image-Text contrastive loss** - 

## Metrics

- Distances in feature space

- Siamese CNNs

- Triplet learning

- N-pair loss with contrastive learning
