# Lecture 1

**Mechanism design** - Engineering approach to Economic Theory. These approaches usually involve an *analysis* step and a *synthesis* step.

In game theory, the typical setup consists of *multiple agents* with possibly conflicting *goals*. Given a game, we usually try to find the most probable outcome on the responses of the agents (**Game Theory** - Analysis). Now, given an outcome, we find and build a game that yields that as a probable outcome (**Mechanism Design** - Synthesis).

 The most optimal outcome need not be the most probable outcome.

Different forms of representing games

- Normal form
- Extensive form
- Repeated, Stochastic, ...

We assume that players are *rational* and *intelligent*. It makes sense to find an equilibrium rather than an optimal state.

# Lecture 2

Consider the “envy free cake division” problem. A third party has to divide a cake between two people so that the people don’t envy each other. A good mechanism for this setup is that one player cuts the cake and the other chooses. It is straightforward to see that it achieves an envy free division.

# Lecture 3

We shall discuss the formal notations in game theory using the example of chess.
