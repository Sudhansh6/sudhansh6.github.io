We'll study the last modern philosopher in our syllabus - John Locke.

## John Locke (1632 - 1704)

Locke concerned himself with the origin of knowledge. He refuted the theory of innate ideas. He believed it was necessary for one to examine their abilities and see what their understand or limit is. According to him, the mind must be conscious of its innate principles, but the mind itself is a blank state/*tabula rasa*.  

Locke was a empiricist. All knowledge is founded on and ultimately derived from experience. The two sources of ideas - sensation and reflection (internal sense mind's operation). Locke introduced the concept of mind being a sense organ, and how its only power is to reflect the sense impressions.

### Ideas

Locke defined ideas as the reflection of the mind. He referred to them as whatsoever the mind directly apprehends, or which is the immediate object of perception, thought, and understanding. For Descartes, mind was an independent entity unlike for Locke.

- Simple ideas - Ideas that enter into the mind only by one sense - color, sound, taste, cold, etc.

- Complex ideas - Space, extension, figure, etc. Some of the complex ideas are received by reflection - observe its own operations on those ideas it already has.

Some ideas are perceived through both sensation and reflection. Among these are pleasure and pain, power, existence, unity succession and duration.

### Qualities

Qualities refer to the power that objects have in producing ideas. 

- Primary quality - solidity, extension, figure, something inherent in the object
- Secondary quality - sound, taste, colors. These secondary qualities are not permanent, and they keep changing.

Descartes explained this using "wax". All our simple ideas are received through the two avenues of sensation and reflection.

### Modes

Modes refer to the way in which impressions are created. There are two types of modes.

- The simple mode consists of variations of the same simple ideas, repeated in different combinations without the mixture of any other; thus a dozen or a score is a mode obtained by the successive addition of unit. (Days, years time and eternity are simple modes of duration).
- Mixed modes are compounded of simple ideas of several kinds, put together to make once complex one, such as beauty.
