**Exercise.**

 Show that $$E( \cdot \vert \mathcal G)$$ is a $$\perp$$ projection where $$d(X, \tilde X) = \sqrt{\mathbb E(X - \tilde X)^2}$$ 

### Tower Property

For any $$\mathcal G \subset \mathcal H ( \subset \mathcal F)$$, we have $$\mathbb E[\mathbb E[X \vert \mathcal H] \vert \mathcal G] = \mathbb E[X \vert \mathcal G]$$.

What does $$\mathcal G \subset \mathcal H$$ mean? In the discrete case where $$\mathcal G = \sigma(G_1, \dots, G_n)$$ and $$\mathcal H = \sigma(H_1, \dots, H_m)$$, we have $$G_k = \dot \cup_{j \in J(k)} H_j$$ where $$J(1),\dots, J(n)$$ is a partition of $$\{1, \dots, m\}$$. 

Now, to show the tower property,

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb E[X \vert G_k] &= \underbrace{\mathbb E[X; G_k]}_{P(G_k)} \\
&= \sum_{j \in J(k)} \underbrace{\mathbb E(X; H_j)}_{P(H_j)}P(H_j \vert G_k) \\
&= \sum_{j \in J(k)} \mathbb E(X \vert H_j)P(H_j \vert G_k)
\end{align*}
$$

   In the trading strategy context, we have $$\mathcal F_0 \subset \mathcal F_1 \subset \dots \subset \mathcal F_n$$. 

### Martingale

We now introduce Martingales formally - A Martingale is a sequence of random variables $$\{M_0, \dots, M_T\}$$ such that 

1. *Adapted:* $$M_t \in \mathcal F_t$$, for all $$t$$

2. *Integrable:* $$\mathbb E(\vert M_t\vert) < \infty$$ for all $$t$$

3. $$\mathbb E(M_t \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1}) = M_{t - 1}$$, $$1 \leq t \leq T$$. From Tower law, $$\mathbb E[M_T \vert \mathcal F_s] = M_s$$.

Let us now revert to our discussion on trading strategies with these formal definitions in mind. 

As we have seen before in #General $$T$$, $$\phi$$ that satisfied $$V_t^*(\phi) := V_t(\phi)/(1 + r)^t$$ is a $$p^*$$-martingale, where $$p^* = \frac{1 + r - d}{u - d}$$.  A special case of this is $$S^*_t$$ is a $$p^*$$- martingale.  We have the following theorem,

**Theorem 2. (General $$T$$)** $$V_0$$ is the arbitrage-free price of $$V$$

*Proof.* We follow a similar structure as before,

1. $$C_0 \neq V_0$$, then arbitrage is available

2. $$C_0 = V_0$$, we have for any strategy $$\psi = \{(\alpha_t, \beta_T, \gamma_1): t = 1, \dots, T\}$$, $$V_0(\psi) = 0, V_T(\psi) \geq 0$$ due to self-financing. Let $$\bar \phi = \{(\bar \alpha_t, \bar \beta_T): t = 1, \dots, T\}$$ be the hedge for $$X$$. Then, $$V_T(\bar \phi) = X$$ and $$V_0(\bar \phi) = V_0$$. 
   
   $$
   \begin{align*}
V_0 (\psi) &= \alpha_1 S_0 + \beta + \gamma_1 C_0 \\
V_T(\psi) &= \alpha_T S_t + \beta_T B_T + \gamma_1 X  
\end{align*}
   $$
   
   Continuing the calculations,
   
   $$
   \begin{align*}
\mathbb E^*(V^*_T(\psi)) &= \mathbb E^*(\alpha_T S^*_T + \beta_T + \gamma_1 X^*) \\
&= \mathbb E^*(V_T(\phi)) + \gamma_1 \mathbb E^*(X^*) \\
&= V_0(\phi) + \gamma_1 C_0 \\
&= V_0 (\psi) = 0 \implies V_T(\psi) = 0
\end{align*}
   $$
   
   Therefore, no arbitrage is possible in this case.

Let us consider a numerical example to understand this better - Consider the call option $$X = (S_T - K)^+$$, where $$T = 4, u = 1.2, d = 0.8, r = 0$$ ($$p^* = 0.5$$). Let $$S_0 = 50$$ and $$K = 40$$.  What is the fair price of $$X$$?

Then, we have the following evolution for $$S_T$$,

$$
50\\
40\quad 60\\
32\quad 48\quad 72\\
25.6\quad 38.4\quad 57.6\quad 87.4\\
20.48\quad 30.72\quad 46.08\quad 69.12\quad 103.68
$$

Consequently, the tree for $$V_0$$ is

$$
13.54\\
1\quad 21.66\\
1.52\quad 10.32\quad 32\\
0\quad 3.04\quad 17.6\quad 46.4\\
0\quad 0 \quad 6.08\quad 29.12 \quad 63.68
$$

We construct the tree recursively, starting from the bottom-most level.  At time $$T$$, we know $$V_T$$, and then we use $$V_t^u p^* + V_t^d(1 - p^*)$$ to get $$V_{t - 1}(1 + r)$$.
