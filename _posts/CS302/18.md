## Declaration Processing

How do we process `int **a[20][10]`? Do we take it as double pointer to an array of 20 rows where each row consists of 10 integers, or do we take it as a 2D-array of double arrays to integers with size $$20 \times 10$$?

In order to do the former, we can use the following grammar 


$$
\begin{align}
decl &\to T \ item; \\
T &\to int \mid double \\
item &\to id \mid item [num]
\end{align}
$$


However, this is an inconvenient layout for 20 arrays of arrays of 10 ints. Suppose we correct it to the following


$$
\begin{align}
decl &\to T \ item; \\
T &\to int \mid double \\
item &\to id \mid  Array \\
Array &\to [num] \mid [num]Array
\end{align}
$$


So basically, we have changed left recursive rule to a right recursive rule. 

We introduce the notion of base types and derived types for We similarly add the size and width attributes in the above rules.

Addition of pointers is easy. We just add the following set of rules to the above set.

$$
\begin{align}
item &\to * \{item2.bt = item.bt\} \\
&\to item2 \\
&\to \{item.dt = pointer(item2.dt); item.s = 4\}
\end{align}x
$$
