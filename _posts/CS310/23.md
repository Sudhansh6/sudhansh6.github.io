> Is countable same as enumerable?  Countable implies  that there is a one-to-one mapping from the elements in the set to natural numbers. This definition is equivalent to that of enumerability.

The theory of Turing machines was developed in the 1930s.

Consider the derivation $$(q_0, w_{inp}) \vdash^*_M (q_k, x)$$ where the machine halts. A machine halts when there is no move at any given state. If $$q_k \in F$$ and the machine $$M$$ halts, then $$M$$ accepts $$w_{inp}$$.

### Variations of Turing Machines

- 2-way infinite tapes
- Multi-tape heads
- Non-determinism
- Output type (write only, immutable)

Let us try and build the Turing machine for $$L = \{a^nb^nc^n \mid n \geq 1\}$$. We’ll use the following logic. In each pass, we will change 1 a, 1 b and 1 c to X, Y and Z respectively. If we have any extra a’s, b’s or c’s, then we will halt.

The machine is given in the above diagram.

> ***Homework.*** Draw a Turing machine for the language $$L = \{ww \mid w \in (a + b)^+\}$$. Hint - Think of subroutines. That is, tackle smaller problems like “Find the middle of the string”, and then match left and right.

## Type-0 Grammars

These are also known as **Unrestricted grammars**. These are essentially same as CFGs but the LHS of rules can be any string. Consider the language $$L = \{a^nb^nc^n\mid n \geq 0\}$$. The grammar can be as follows


$$
\begin{align}
S &\to ABCS \mid T_c \\
CA &\to AC \\
BA &\to AB \\ 
CB &\to BC \\
CT_c &\to T_cc \\ 
BT_b &\to T_bb \\
AT_a &\to T_aa \\
T_c &\to T_b \\ 
T_b &\to T_a \\
T_a &\to \epsilon
\end{align}
$$


If one notices closely, then there are a few issues with this grammar. However, it is correct considering non-determinism. That is, a terminal string derived from this grammar will be in $$L$$.
