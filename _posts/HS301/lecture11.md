Now, we shall study Plato. As previously discussed, Plato was a disciple of Socrates. His ideology is summarised as follows.

## Plato - Theory of Ideas

The central theme of the theory of ideas is the *nature of the essence* of things and how we perceive them. Socrates was interested in moral knowledge and ethics.  Plato was inclined to know about the definitions of the very concepts discussed by Socrates. He also gave importance to Ontology and Metaphysics. He felt this was missing in Socrates' ideas. Therefore, Metaphysics and Ontology once again came into the discourse of philosophy.

## Plato and his Philosophical problem

Plato tried to compose learnings from other philosophers like Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Protagoras. This comprehensive outlook shows the link between epistemology, ontology, and ethics - What are the meanings of life and its existence?

- Plato believed that genuine knowledge is changeless, eternal, and absolute (from Parmenides).
- Sense experiences vary, and therefore sensuous appearances keep changing (from Heraclitus).
- Plato emphasized that the real can be comprehended through reason.

## Dialectical Method

Socrates practiced this, but Plato conceptualized this idea. This method consists of

- Comprehension of scattered particulars into one idea
- The division of the idea into species for generalization.

In this way, one can follow clear and consistent thinking. This is the foundation of deductive reasoning.

## Concepts, Ideas, and Forms

Plato's originality lies in raising the issue of universals. Coming to conclusions using representative of general classes, say, trees. *Similar* because they partake of similarity. Plato makes a distinction between a universal and a particular. 

Forms are a manifestation of similarity. Humans are all similar. A quality of "human-ness". Just and beautiful because they partake of justice and beauty. 

## What is an idea?

Plato disagreed with Parmenides on this topic. Parmenides stated that an idea is not a thought, whereas Plato theorized that an idea may be an *object* of thought.  Parmenides believed that there was only one idea. On the other hand, Plato devised that there are multiple ideas, and they are indivisible.

Ideas are not known to us because human knowledge is not absolute - Parmenides. This statement again goes back to Skepticism. Plato said, "Ideas are universal and eternal and not subject to change". One can see a horse, but one cannot see "horseness". This inconceivable ontological concept is intelligible. The knowledge of particulars is given to us by the sense experiences, unlike the universals. Therefore, these ideas correspond to abstract concepts. They exist in an *independent realm*, are *non-temporal*, and participate in particulars.

We say ideas are non-temporal because particulars are temporal/ have a finite existence.

## Epistemology and Metaphysics

Plato says **the soul** is the knowledge of *Forms*. It is identical to the concept of the mind today. A soul can contemplate on pure eternal ideas, and *knowledge is latent in the soul*.

The idea of Unity and Diversity. The idea of Good is **Logos**.

> Logos - The principle of divine reason or cosmic order

The meaning of Good cannot be grasped by the senses. Unity (Metaphysical form) of universals and Diversity (Ontological) of particulars. Ideas are only intelligible. They can be learned by dialectic methods.

For a realist, ideas are an illusion. However, Plato believed ideas are real. Our perception through our senses is not the actual reality. A realist believes in sensory experiences. In contrast, reality may be different from what we perceive.

Difference between a soul and an idea? The soul is a part of human life. The soul is eternal, according to Plato. We can relate to forms using our souls. A soul can relate itself to ideas.
