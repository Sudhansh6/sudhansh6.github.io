## Role of Semantic Analysis



- We have seen **lexical errors** and **syntax errors**. Name and scope analysis cannot be done using scanner and parser (as our grammar is context free). These are detected by semantic analyser and are known as **semantic errors**.

  Compilers usually try to list all the errors in the program by trying to recover from each error, and continue compiling the remaining code.

- C++ requires references to be initialised.
- Overflow shows up as a warning and not as an error. Why? This is because type conversions are allowed in C++. These sort of errors are **runtime errors**.

- Suppose we have the following program

  ````cpp
  int i = 40;
  
  cout<< 1 <= i <= 5 <<endl;
  ````

  The output of this code is `1` and not `0`. This is because `1 <= i` is evaluated as `True`(`1`) and `1 <= 5` is `True`.

  This is a runtime activity and the error cannot be identified by a compiler (unless constant propagation optimisation is performed). This error is known as a **logical error**.

  Runtime and Logical errors are usually not detected by the compiler.

- Does `int a[3] = {1, 2, 3, 4};` give an error? Yes! (Too many initialisers) It’s a semantic error. What if we had `int a[4] = {1, 2, 3};cout<<a[3];`? It does not give an error or a warning. It gives a *runtime error* in the form of a **segmentation fault**.

- Suppose we had the following code

  ```cpp
  int f(int a)
  {
  	if (a > 5) return 0;
  }
  ```

  Does this give an error? No, the compiler gives a warning that says “control reaches end of non-void function.” Such functions can be used to generate pseudorandom numbers. However, does `f(-5)` give a runtime error? No, it returns `-5`. Why is that so?

  Also, if the definition of `f` was modified to the following, then we get random numbers

  ```cpp
  int f(int a)
  {
  	if (a > 5) return 0;
  	cout << a << endl;
  }
  ```

  But again, if `f` is modified to below, we start getting `-5` everytime.

  ```cpp
  int f(int a)
  {
    if (a > 5) return 0;
    cout << a << endl;
    a = a + 5;
  }
  // Or the following f
  int f(int a)
  {
  	if (a > 5) return 0;
  	g(a);
  }
  ```

  Many such variations are possible with different behaviours. Also, the output of the program depends on the compiler flags too!

  The language specifications say that a variable must be declared before its use but may not be defined before its use.

- Consider the following code

  ```cpp
  float inc = 0.1, sum = 0;
  while (inc != 1.0)
  {
  	sum += inc;
  	inc += 0.1;
  }
  ```

  This program can go into an infinite loop due to **floating imprecision**. This is a runtime activity and cannot be detected by a compiler. We will classify this as a logical error and not a runtime error. Remember that `0` does not cause any imprecision!

- Consider the following code

  ```cpp
  void f(short a) {cout<<"short";}
  void f(long a) {cout<<"long";}
  void f(char a) {cout<<"char";}
  int main ()
  {
  	f(100);
  }
  ```

  How does the compiler decide which function to use? There is a difficulty in resolving function overloading. This is a **semantic error**. If we had a definition for `int`, then there would not be any issue, as integer is a default type. 

  Also, comparison of string and integer will give a **syntax error**.

- `main` in C can be recursive!
