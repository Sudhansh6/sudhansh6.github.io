abstract = {Practical sensing systems have a limited dynamic range, which gives rise to saturation noise in signal acquisition if the signal attains values outside this range at certain locations. Despite rapid advances in compressed sensing theory and systems over the years, the effect of saturation on compressed sensing measurements, especially in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, has often been overlooked in many existing approaches.  In this paper, we propose a novel maximum likelihood based estimator for compressive reconstruction in the presence of both Gaussian and saturation noise. },

      abstract = {Finding a high-quality solution for the tabletop object rearrangement planning is a challenging problem. Compared to determining a goal arrangement, rearrangement planning is challenging due to the dependencies between objects and the buffer capacity available to hold objects. Although orla* has proposed an A* based searching strategy with lazy evaluation for the high-quality solution, it is not scalable, with the success rate decreasing as the number of objects increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced A*-based algorithm that improves state representation and employs incremental goal attempts with lazy evaluation at each iteration. This approach aims to enhance scalability while maintaining solution quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm can provide superior solutions compared to orla*, in a shorter time, for both stationary and mobile robots.},
