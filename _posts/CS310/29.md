Term matching is don’t care non-determinism. There might be multiple possible reductions at any given situation, and all will lead to the same answer in case of well-formed normal forms. Also, all the paths should terminate.

What are the strategies for computing normal forms? 

- **Hybrid** - Check if sub-term matches rule-by-rule
- **Innermost** - Many programming languages adopt this. Evaluate the “lowest” redex first.
- **Outermost** - This is lazy evaluation. We evaluate topmost redex first.

Redex is a sub-term where a rule can be applied.

And then, sir lost his connection :D
