## MapReduce Paradigm

The goal here is to be able to run many queries/scripts across a large number of machines. `Map` and `Reduce` have similar functionalities as seen in Python. Programmers realised many operations can be reduced to a sequence of map and reduce actions (popular in functional programming). 

Google formalised the notion of map-reduce for web-crawling and other web-development needs as map-reduce workers. This paradigm was used along with distributed file systems.

The default input for the map operations is a line. 

```
map(k, v) -> list(k1, v1)
reduce(k1, list(v1)) -> v2
```

However, map-reduce code for database queries was large. So, the developers at Facebook came up with Hive which converts SQL queries to map-reduce queries.

## Algebraic Operations

We shall study these as a part of **Spark**.
