description: MathPrompter++ improves the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on numerical problems with robustness by embedding zero-shot CoT in a former Microsoft Research paper - MathPrompter ICLR 2023. The method improves the accuracy while reducing the hallucinate rate. Furthermore, I compiled a new dataset DiverseMath that serves as a better benchmark for reasoning in numerical problems.
