### Extraneous attributes

Removing an attribute from the left side of a functional dependency makes it a stronger constraint. Attribute A is extraneous in $$\alpha$$ if

- $$ A \in \alpha$$
- $$F$$ logically implies $$(F - \{\alpha \to \beta\}) \cup \{(\alpha - A) \to \beta\}$$

To test this, consider $$\gamma = \alpha - \{A\}$$. Check if $$\gamma \to \beta$$ can be inferred from $$F$$. We do this by computing $$\gamma^+$$ using the dependencies in $$F$$, and if it includes all attributes in $$\beta$$ then $$A$$ is extraneous in $$\alpha$$.

On the other hand, removing an attribute from the right side of a functional dependency could make it a weaker constraint. Attribute A is extraneous in $$\beta$$ if 

- $$A \in \beta$$

- The set of functional dependencies

  $$(F - \{\alpha \to \beta\}) \cup \{\alpha \to ( \beta - A)\}$$ logically implies $$F$$.

To test this, consider $$F’ = (F - \{\alpha \to \beta\}) \cup \{\alpha \to ( \beta - A)\}$$ and check if $$\alpha^+$$ contains A; if it does, then $$A$$ is extraneous in $$\beta$$.

## Canonical Cover Revisited

A **canonical cover** for $$F$$ is a set of dependencies $$F_c$$ such that 

-  $$F$$($$F_c$$) logically implies all dependencies in $$F_c$$($$F$$)
- No functional dependency in $$F_c$$ contains an extraneous attribute
- <u>Each left side of functional dependency in $$F_c$$ is unique</u>

To compute a canonical cover for $$F$$ do the following

```
Fc = F
repeat
	Use the union rule to replace any dependencies in Fc of the form
		alpha -> beta and alpha -> gamma with
    alpha -> beta gamma
	Find a functional dependency alpha to beta 
	in Fc with an extraneous attribute 
	in alpha or in beta
	Delete extraneous attribute if found
until Fc does not change
```

## Dependency Preservation - 3

Let $$F_i$$ be the set of dependencies $$F^+$$ that include only the attribtues in $$R_i$$. A decomposition is **dependency preserving** if $$(F_1 \cup \dots \cup F_n)^+ = F^+$$. However, we can’t use this definition to test for dependency preserving as it takes exponential time. 

We test for dependency preservation in the following way. To check if a dependency $$\alpha \to \beta$$ is preserved in a decomposition, apply the following test

```
result = alpha
repeat
	for each Ri in the decomposition
		t = (result cap Ri)^+ cap Ri
		result = result \cup t
until result does not change
```

If the result contains all attributes in $$\beta$$, then the functional dependency $$\alpha \to \beta$$ is preserved. This procedure takes polynomial time. 

## Testing for BCNF

To check if a non-trivial dependency $$\alpha \to \beta$$ cause a violation of BCNF, compute $$\alpha^+$$ and verify that it includes all attributes of $$R$$. Another simpler method is to check only the dependencies in the given set $$F$$ for violations of BCNF rather than checking all dependencies in $$F^+$$. If none of the dependencies in $$F$$ cause a violation, then none of the dependencies in $$F^+$$ will cause a violation. *Think.*

However, the simplified test using only $$F$$ is incorrect when testing a relation in  a decomposition of $$R$$. For example, consider $$R = (A, B, C, D, E)$$, with $$F = \{ A \to B, BC \to D\}$$ and the decomposition $$R_1 = (A, B), R_2 = (A, C, D, E)$$. Now, neither of the dependencies in $$F$$ contain only attributes from $$(A, C, D, E)$$ so we might be misled into thinking $$R_2$$ satisfies BCNF. 

Therefore, testing decomposition requires the restriction of $$R^+$$ to that particular set of tables. If one wants to the use the original set of dependencies $$F$$, then they must check that $$\alpha^+$$ either includes no attributes of $$R_i - \alpha$$ or includes all attributes of $$R_i$$ for every set of attributes $$\alpha \subseteq R$$.  If a condition $$\alpha \to \beta \in F^+$$ violates BCNF, then the dependency $$\alpha \to (\alpha^+ - \alpha) \cap R_i$$ can be shown to hold on $$R_i$$ and violate BCNF.

In conclusion, the BCNF decomposition algorithm is given by

```
result = R
done = false
compute F+
while (not done) do
	if (there is a schema Ri in result that is not in BCNF)
		let alpha to beta be a nontrivial functional dependency
      that holds on Ri such that alpha to Ri
      is not in F+
      and alpha cap beta is null
 		result = {(result - Ri),(Ri - beta),(alpha, beta)}
 	else done = true
		
```

Note that each $$R_i$$ is in BCNF and decomposition is lossless-join.

## 3NF

The main drawback of BCNF is that is may not be dependency preserving.  Through 3NF, we allow some redundancy to acquire dependency preserving along with lossless join.

To test for 3NF, we only have to check the FDs in $$F$$ and not all the FDs in $$F^+$$.We use attribute closure to check for each dependency $$\alpha \to \beta $$, if $$\alpha$$ is a super key. If $$\alpha$$ is not a super key, we need to check if each attribute in $$\beta$$ is contained in a candidate key of $$R$$. 

However, this test is shown to be NP-hard, but the decomposition into third normal form can be done in polynomial time.

> Doesn’t decomposition imply testing? No, one relation can have many 3NF decompositions.

### 3NF Decomposition Algorithm

```
Let Fc be a canconical cover for F;
i = 0;
/* initial schema is empty */
for each FD alpha to beta in Fc do
	if none of the schemas Rj (j <= i) contains alpha beta
		then begin
			i = i + 1
			Ri = alpha beta
		end
/* Here, each of the FDs will be contained in one of the Rjs */
if none of the schemas Rj (j <= i) contains a candidate key for R
  then begin
    i = i + 1
    Ri = any candidate key for R
  end
/* Here, there is a relation contianing the candidate key of R */
/* Optionally remove redundant relations */
repeat
  if any schema Rj is contained in another schema Rk
    then delete Rj
      Rj = Ri;
      i = i - 1
  return (R1, ..., Ri)
```

Guaranteeing that the above set of relations are in 3NF is the easy part. However, proving that the decomposition is lossless is difficult.

### Comparison of BCNF and 3NF

3NF has redundancy whereas BCNF may not be dependency preserving. The bigger problem is 3Nf allows certain function dependencies which are not super key dependencies. However, none of the SQL implementations today support such FDs.

## Multivalued Dependencies

Let $$R$$ be a relation schema and let $$\alpha, \beta \subseteq R$$ . The multivalued dependency 


$$
\alpha \to\to \beta
$$


 holds on $$R$$ if in any legal relation $$r(R)$$, for all pairs for tuples $$t_1, t_2$$ in $$r$$ such that $$t_1[\alpha] = t_2[\alpha]$$, there exists tuples $$t_3$$ and $$t_4$$ in $$r$$ such that 


$$
t_1[\alpha] = t_2[\alpha] = t_3[\alpha] = t_4[\alpha] \\ 
t_3[\beta] = t_1[\beta] \\
t_3[R - \beta] = t_2[R - \beta] \\
t_4[\beta] = t_2[\beta] \\
t_4[R - \beta] = t_1[R - \beta]
$$


Intuitively, it means that the relationship between $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ is independent of the remaining attributes in the relation. The tabular representation of these conditions is given by

![image-20220217224504065](/assets/img/Databases/image-20220217224504065.png)



The definition can also be mentioned in a more intuitive manner. Consider the attributes of $$R$$ that are partitioned into 3 nonempty subsets $$W, Y, Z$$. We say that $$Y \to\to Z$$ iff for all possible relational instances $$r(R)$$, 


$$
<y_1, z_1, w_1> \in r \text{ and } < y_1, z_2, w_2 > \in r \\
\implies \\
<y_1, z_1, w_2 > \in r \text{ and } <y_1, z_2, w_1 > \in r
$$


**Important Points**- 

- If $$Y \to\to Z$$ then $$Y \to\to W$$
- If $$Y \to Z$$ then $$Y \to\to Z$$

> why?

The closure $$D^+$$ of $$D$$ is the set of all functional and multivalued dependencies logically implied by $$D$$. We are not covering the reasoning here.

## Fourth Normal Form

A relation schema $$R$$ is in 4NF rt a set $$D$$ of functional and multivalued dependencies if for all multivalued dependencies in $$D^+$$ in the form $$\alpha \to\to \beta$$, where $$\alpha, \beta \subseteq R$$, at least one of the following hold

- $$\alpha \to\to \beta$$ is trivial
- $$\alpha$$ is a super key for schema $$R$$

<u>If a relation is in 4NF, then it is in BCNF.</u> That is, 4NF is stronger than BCNF. Also, 4NF is the generalisation of BCNF for multivalued dependencies.

### Restriction of MVDs

The restriction of $$D$$ to $$R_i$$ is the set $$D_i$$ consisting of 

- All functional dependencies in $$D^+$$ that include only attributes of $$R_i$$
- All multivalued dependencies of the form $$\alpha \to \to (\beta \cap R_i)$$ where $$\alpha \in R_i$$ and $$\alpha \to\to \beta \in D^+$$.

### 4NF Decomposition Algorithm

```
result = {R};
done = false;
compute D+
Let Di denote the restriction of D+ to Ri
while(not done)
	if (there is a schema Ri in result not in 4NF)
		let alpha to to beta be a nontrivial MVD that holds
		on Ri such that  alpha to Ri is not in Di and 
		alpha cap beta is null
		result = {result - Ri, Ri - beta, (alpha, beta)}
	else done = true
```

This algorithm is very similar to that of BCNF decomposition.
