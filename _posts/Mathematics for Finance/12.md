#### Assume viability -

We have noted that $$L$$ is a subspace of $$\mathbb R^n$$. Also, $$F$$ is compact and convex.

**Lemma.** ***Separating Hyperplane Theorem*** For a vector subspace $$L \subseteq \mathbb R^n$$ and a compact convex set $$F$$, if $$L \cap F = \phi$$, then there exists a $$\zeta \in \mathbb R^n$$,  $$\zeta \neq 0$$ such that

$$
\begin{align*}
L &\subset \{t: t \cdot \zeta = 0\} \\
F &\subset \{y: y \cdot z > 0\}
\end{align*}
$$

*Proof.* Let $$G:= F - L = \{f - l: f \in F, l \in L\}$$, then $$G$$ is convex and closed and $$0 \not \in G$$. We choose the vector $$\zeta \in G$$ that minimizes $$\|x\|$$, $$x \in G$$. Now,

$$
\beta := \inf \{\|x \|: x \in G \}
$$

then for any sequence $$x_n \in G$$ such that $$\|x_n\|$$ converges to $$\beta$$ ($$\|x_n\| \searrow \beta$$) , using the parallelogram law

$$
\begin{align*}
    \|x_n - x_m\|^2 &= 2(\|x_n\|^2 + \|x_m\|^2) - 4\left\|\frac{x_n + x_m}{2}\right\|^2 \\
\end{align*}
$$

 The terms $$\|x_n\|^2, \|x_m\|^2$$ converge to $$\beta^2$$ and the average $$\left|\frac{x_n + x_m}{2}\right|^2$$ goes to  $$\beta^2$$ leading to $$\|x_n - x_m\|^2 \to 0$$ for $$m, n \to \infty$$ and $$x_n \to \zeta$$. Therefore, $$\{x_n\}$$ form a Cauchy sequence convergent to some $$\zeta$$. Since $$G$$ is closed, this shows the existence of such $$\zeta \in G$$.

Now, for any $$x \in G $$, $$x \cdot \zeta \geq \|\zeta\|^2$$. How do we show this? Consider any arbitrary vector formed by $$x, \zeta$$,  $$\|\alpha x + (1 - \alpha)\zeta\|^2 - \|\zeta\|^2 \geq 0$$ (a quadratic in $$\alpha$$, and $$0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$$).  For $$\alpha \to 0$$, we get

$$
-2 \|\zeta^2\|  + 2(x\cdot \zeta) \geq 0
$$

Now, in particular, since $$0 \in L$$, if $$f \in G$$, then $$f \in F$$. Consequently, if $$f \in F$$, then for any $$\lambda \in \mathbb R, l \in L$$, $$f - \lambda l \in G$$. We get

$$
f\cdot \zeta \geq \lambda (l \cdot \zeta) + \|\zeta\|^2
$$

With the limits of $$\lambda$$, we can conclude that $$l \cdot \zeta = 0$$. $$\square$$

How does this theorem help us show $$L \cap F = \phi$$ for a viable market? Consider the EMM $$Q(w_k) = \frac{\zeta_k}{c} > 0$$. $$c = \sum_{i = 1}^n \zeta_i$$. For a fixed $$k$$, consider

$$
Y_i = \begin{cases} 1 & i = k \\ 0 & i \neq k \end{cases} 
$$

Then for $$Y \in F$$, $$Y \cdot \zeta > 0$$. Let $$\phi$$ be a trading strategy with $$V_0(\phi) = 0$$, then

$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb E^Q(V_t^*(\phi)) &= Q\cdot V^*_T(\phi) \\
&= \frac{1}{c} \left[\zeta \cdot \underbrace{V_t^*(\phi)}_{\in L}\right] = 0
\end{align*}
$$

### Completeness of a Market

A merket is complete if for every contingent claim $$X \in \mathcal F_T$$, there exists a trading strategy $$\phi$$ that can be replicate the claim with $$V_T(\phi) \equiv X$$.  

## Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing

Assuming the market is viable, then the market is complete if and only if there is a unique EMM for the market.

*Proof.*

1. $$(\implies)$$ Assume that the market is complete. Let $$P_1^*, P_2^*$$ be the distinct EMMs. Then for a $$A \in \mathcal F_T$$, define $$X:= \mathbb 1_A$$. Due to completeness, $$\exists \phi$$ with $$V_T(\phi) = \mathbb 1_A$$. 
   
   $$
   \begin{align*}
P_i^*(A) &= \mathbb E_i^*(\mathbb 1_A) \\
&= \mathbb E_1^*(V_T(\phi)) = \frac{S^0_T}{S^0_0} \cdot V_0(\phi)
\end{align*}
   $$
   
   Therefore, $$P_1^*(A) = P_2^*(A)$$ for all $$A \in \mathcal F_T$$ implying that $$P_1^* = P_2^*$$.

2. ($$\Longleftarrow$$ ) Assuming that there is a unique EMM, we need to show that the market is complete. We do this by proving the contrapositive - a market is incomplete implies that there is no unique EMM for the market. We define 
   
   $$
   L:= \{V_T^*(\phi): \phi \text{ self-financing trading strategies }\}
   $$
   
   Now, we show that the market is incomplete if and only if $$L \subsetneq \mathbb R^n$$ and $$\exists z \neq 0$$ such that $$z \perp L$$. Consider the EMM $$Q$$ for a viable market. Then, define $$\tilde Q(w_k) = Q(w_k) + c z_k$$ for some $$c > 0$$. Then,
   
   $$
   \sum_{k = 1}^n \tilde Q(w_k) = \sum_{k = 1}^n Q(w_k) + c (z \cdot \bf{1}) = 1 + 0
   $$
   
   Is $$\bf{1} \in L$$? Yes, the strategy of investing in one bond yields a discounted value of $$1$$ at $$T$$.
