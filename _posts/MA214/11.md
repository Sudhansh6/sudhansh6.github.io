> What if you take a linear function and use $$n >2$$ points for Lagrange interpolation? Will the final function be linear? It should be.
>
> For example, in class we considered $$f(1) = 1$$ and $$f(2) = 1$$. These values gave a constant polynomial.

In general, for $$(n + 1)$$-points, the interpolating polynomial will have degree **at most** $$n$$.

## Uniqueness of the interpolating polynomial

For a given set of $$(n + 1)$$ points, we can have infinitely many polynomials which interpolate it. However, there exists a **unique polynomial with degree** $$\mathbf {\leq n}$$. This result follows from the well-known theorem -

***Theorem.*** A polynomial of degree $$n$$ has at most $$n$$ distinct zeroes.

**Corollary.** A polynomial with degree $$\leq n$$ with $$(n + 1)$$ zeroes is the zero polynomial.

## Error of the interpolating polynomial

***Theorem.*** Let $$f:[a,b] \to \mathbb R$$ be $$(n + 1)$$-times continuously differentiable. Let $$P(x)$$ be the polynomial interpolating $$f$$ at distinct $$(n + 1)$$ points $$x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n \in [a, b]$$. Then, for each $$x \in [a, b]$$, there exists $$\xi(x) \in (a, b)$$ with 


$$
f(x) = P(x) + \frac{f^{(n + 1)}(\xi(x))}{(n + 1)!}(x - x_0)(x - x_1)\cdots (x - x_n)
$$


> How? Intuition?

Using the above theorem, we can calculate the <u>maximum possible value of the absolute error</u> in an interval. 

**Note.** While checking for extreme values in an interval, do not forget to check the value of the function at the edge of the interval!
