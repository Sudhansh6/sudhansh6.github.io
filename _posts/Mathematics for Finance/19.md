## Localization

We define the set

$$
\mathcal L_{loc} := \{Y: Y \text{ is progressive and } P\left(\int_0^t Y_s^2ds < \infty\right) = 1\}
$$

This is a weaker condition than $$\mathbb E[\int_0^t Y_S^2 ds] < \infty$$, and it allows us to generalize the notion of $$\int_0^t Y_s dWs$$ to more integrands.

Given a $$Y \in \mathcal L_{loc}$$, we define the stop times $$\tau(n) = \inf \{t: \int_0^t Y_s^2 ds > n\} \wedge T$$. Then,

$$
\cap_n \{\tau(n) < T\} \subset \left\{\int_0^T Y_s^2 ds = \infty\right\}
$$

so $$P(\tau(n) < T) \to 0$$ as $$n \to \infty$$. Furthermore, defining $$Y_s^{(n)} = \mathbb 1_{(0, \tau(n)]} (s) Y_s$$, we get

$$\int_0^T (Y_s^{(n)})^2 ds \leq n^2$$ implying that $$Y^{(n)} \in \mathcal L$$. Also, the martingale $$\int_0^t Y_s^{(n)} dW_s$$ is well-defined for each $$n = 1, 2, \dots$$. 

They are also consistent - For $$m < n$$, $$\tau(m) < \tau(n)$$ and 

$$
\int_0^t Y_s^{(m)} dW_s = \int_0^t Y_s^{(n)} dW_s
$$

if $$t \in [0, \tau(m)]$$.

Since $$P(\tau(n) < T) \to 0$$ as $$n \to \infty$$, and on $$\cup_n \{\tau(n) = T\}$$, we have

$$
I_t = \lim_n \int_0^t Y_s^{(n)}dW_s, 0 \leq t \leq T
$$

and $$I_{t \wedge \tau(n)} = \int_0^t Y_s^{(n)} dW_s$$ is a martingale.

This process $$I$$, which we use as our definition of $$\int_0^t Y_s dW_s$$ is an instance of a **local martingale**. 

A **local martingale** is an adapted process $$M = (M_t)$$ for which there is an increasing sequence $$(\sigma(n))$$ of stopping times such that $$P(\sigma(n) < T) \to 0 $$ as $$n \to \infty$$ and $$M_{t \wedge \sigma(n)}$$ is a martingale.

When the martingales and local martingales have continuous paths, $$(\sigma(n))$$ can be taken to be $$\sigma(n) = \inf(t: \vert M_t \vert n) \wedge T$$. In particular it can always be arranged that $$\vert M_{t \wedge \sigma(n)} \vert \leq K_n$$ for all $$t$$.

## Ito's Process

An Ito's process is a continuous adapted process $$X = (X_t)$$ of the form

$$
X_t = X_0 + \int_0^t Y_s dW_s + \int_0^t b_s ds, 0 \leq t \leq T
$$

where $$Y \in \mathcal L_{loc}$$ and $$b = (b_s)$$ is progressive with $$\int_0^T \vert b_s\vert ds < \infty$$.

Revisiting the notion of quadratic variation, the **quadratic variation of** $$X$$ is formally defined as $$\langle X\rangle$$ -

$$
\langle X\rangle_t = \int_0^t Y_s^2 ds, 0 \leq t \leq T
$$

For a non-random continuous function $$g$$, the process $$G_t = \int_0^t g(s)ds$$ has $$0$$ quadratic variation.

**Theorem (Ito Formula II)** Let $$f: \mathbb R \times [0, T]$$ be of class $$C^{2, 1}$$. If $$X$$ is an Ito's process as defined above, then so is $$f(X_t, t)$$ with

$$
f(X_t,t) = F(X_0, 0) + \int_0^t f_x(X_s, s)dX_s + \int_0^t f_t(X_s, s)ds + \frac{1}{2} \int_0^t f_{xx} (X_s, s_ d)\langle X\rangle_s
$$

where $$dX_s = Y_s dW_s + B_s ds$$ and $$d\langle X\rangle_s = Y^2_s ds$$.

### Example

Consider the case of Stochastic exponential,

For a $$Y \in \mathcal L_{loc}$$ we define $$M_t = \int_0^t Y_s dW_s$$ (local martingale). Define

$$
Z_t = \exp(M_t - \frac{1}{2} \langle M\rangle_t), 0\leq t\leq T
$$

By Ito's formula for $$f(x) = e^x$$ and Ito's process $$X_t = M_t - \frac{1}{2} \langle M\rangle_t$$, we have

$$
Z_t = 1 + \int_0^t z_s dM_s \equiv dZ_t = Z_t dM_t \;\&\; Z_0 = 1 
$$

Again, $$Z$$ is a local martingale. 

- Since $$(Z_t)$$ is a strictly positive local martingale, it's a supermartingale (**Fatou's Lemma**)

- If $$\vert Y_s(w)\vert \leq K$$ for all $$s, w$$, then $$Z\cdot Y \in \mathcal L$$ and $$Z$$ is a true martingale.
