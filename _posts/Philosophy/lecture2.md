# Lecture 2

We had a brief discussion on the meaning of philosophy and its origins. It originated from the metaphysical questions that try to understand reality. 

**Metaphysics** studies ***ontology*** or the *existence of being*. At the beginning of the philosophical discourse, the metaphysical question was about *how reality has come into being*.

**Epistemology** is the heart of Metaphysics. It refers to the theory of knowledge. It talks about beliefs and ideas and tries to justify/evaluate them. Basically, knowledge is a *justified true belief*. The thirst for learning about reality or philosophical thinking is due to epistemology. 

> Doxa - common belief or popular opinion

## Who is a Philosopher?

A person who formulates a perspective, refutes ideas, and critiques philosophical theories. 

A philosopher can express their discontent with an existing idea and point out errors in these ideas. They should be able to prove whatever is acceptable using their knowledge and experience. This way, an idea would sustain through generations. Experience is the foundation of knowledge.

Ptolemy believed in the *geocentric* model of the solar system. On the other hand, Copernicus believed in the *heliocentric* model. People gradually shifted to Copernicus' theory. This was known as the *Copernican revolution*. This developed a new philosophical study called *critical thinking*.

## Metaphysical question

It refers to questions such as "Who am I?" "What constitutes my being?" and "Am I a body?". 

Philosophical inquiring initiates specific fundamental questions concerning humanity. What is life? What is suffering? What is truth? What is happiness? What is justice?

In science, we have 3 propositions or *Laws of Nature*

- Missed this
- Law of Causality
- Law of transformation of energy

The Law of causality is a metaphysical concept. To answer any of the metaphysical questions, we try to develop a causal relationship.

## Philosophizing

To understand these questions or seek an answer to these questions, we need to study some philosophers. We need to have a deep reflection on experience. 

Philosophizing is a part of our critical inquiry into these questions. A philosopher should be able to build a new perspective.
