# Black-Scholes Model

The prices are given by

$$
\begin{align*}
S_t &= S_0 \exp(\sigma W_t + \mu t) \\
B_t &= e^{rt}
\end{align*}
$$

A trading strategy is $\phi = \{(\alpha_t, \beta_t): 0 \leq t \leq T\}$ where $\alpha_t, \beta_t$ are progressively measurable.

> Progressively measurable - $\int_0^T \alpha_s^2 ds < \infty$ and $\int_0^T \|\beta_s\|ds < \infty$

Self-financing property yields

$$
\begin{align*}
V_t(\phi) - V_0(\phi) = \int_0^t \left(\alpha_u dS_u + \beta_u dB_u \right), 0 \leq t \leq T
\end{align*}
$$

where $dS_u = S_u(\sigma dW_u + \mu du)$ and $dB_u = re^{ru}du$.

The importance of $\alpha$ being progressively measurable comes in handy here, since we want $\sigma \alpha S_u \in \mathcal L_{loc}$ . That is because $S_u$ is positive, $\int_0^T \alpha_u^2 S_u^2 du < \infty \iff \int_0^T \alpha_u^2 du < \infty$

Once again, we define the discounted processes

$$
\begin{align*}
V_t^*(\phi) &= V_t(\phi) /B_t = V_t e^{-rt} \\
S_t^*(\phi) &= S_t(\phi) /B_t = S_t e^{-rt} \\
\end{align*}
$$

and consequently, 

$$
V_t^*(\phi) - V_0(\phi) = \int_0^t \alpha_u dS^*_u
$$

#### Product Rule for Ito's Calculus

Suppose we have two Ito's processes $X_t = X_0 + \int_0^t H_s dWs + \int_0^T bs_ds$ + $Y_t = Y_0 + \int_0^t K_s dWs + \int_0^T cs_ds$, then their product is also an Ito's process

$$
d(X_tY_t) = X_t dY_t + Y_t dX_t + d(X,Y)_t
$$

where $\langle X, Y \rangle_t = \int_0^t H_sK_s ds$ is the quadratic covariation. 

### Arbitrage

An arbitrage is a self-financing trading strategy $\phi$ is such that $V_0(\phi) = 0$ and $V_T(\phi) \geq 0$ with $P(V_T(\phi) > 0)> 0$. 

The binomial model is viable and complete. However, it is easy to create arbitrage opportunities in Black-Scholes model -

$$
\begin{align*}
I_t &= \int_0^t \frac{1}{\sqrt{T - s}} dW_u, 0\leq t < T \\
\langle I \rangle_t &= \log\frac{T}{T - t} \nearrow \infty \text{ as } t \nearrow T
\end{align*}
$$

The quadratic variation represents the energy of the martingale in a way. We further define $\tau_q = \inf (t: I_t = a) \wedge T$ for some $a > 0$ ($P(\tau_a < T) = 1$). Now, the trading strategy is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
\alpha_t &= \mathbb 1_{t \leq T} \frac{1}{\sqrt{T - t}} \frac{1}{S_t} \\
\beta_t &= I_{t \wedge \tau_a} - \alpha_t s_t
\end{align*}
$$

Let $r = 0, B_t = 1$ for simplicity. Then,

$$
\begin{align*}
V_t(\phi) = I_{t \wedge \tau_a}
\end{align*}
$$

implying $V_0(\phi) = , V_T(\phi) = I_{\tau_a} = a > 0$. 

### Equivalent Martingale Measure

When $\mu = 0$, we have $S_t = S_0 e^{\sigma W_t - \sigma^2t/2}$ is a martingale. Then, $P$ itself is an EMM. When $\mu \neq 0$, we need to find a $Q$ on $(\Omega, \mathcal F_T)$ that is equivalent to $P$. How do we check equivalence here? $Q(A) > 0 \iff P(A)> 0$ for all $A \in \mathcal F_t$. 

#### Girsanov's Theorem

Let $H \in \mathcal L_{loc}$ and $M_t = \int_0^t H_S dW_s$ and $\langle M \rangle_t = \int_0^t H_s^2 ds$, then

$$
\Lambda_t := \exp(M_t - \frac{1}{2} \langle M\rangle_t) = 1 + \int_0^t \Lambda_s dM_s
$$

is continuous in $t$, positive, local martingale and a supermartingale. We have $\mathbb E(\Lambda_t) \leq 1$, $t \in [0, T]$. The process is a martingale when $\mathbb E(\Lambda_t) = 1$. 

Now, the theorem states that suppose $\mathbb E(\Lambda_t) = 1$ for all $t \in [0, T]$ ($\iff \mathbb E(\Lambda_T) = 1 \iff \Lambda_t$ is a martingale ). We define 

$$
Q(A) := \mathbb E^P (\mathbb 1_A \Lambda_T), A \in \mathcal F_T
$$

then $Q \sim P$ and 

$$
N_t := \int_0^t Y_s dW_s
$$

for $Y \in \mathcal L_{loc}$ is a local martingale with respect to $P$ and

$$
\tilde N_t = N_t - \int_0^t Y_s H_s ds
$$

is a local martingale with respect to $Q$.

Finally, $\langle N \rangle_t = \langle \tilde N\rangle_t$. In particular, consider

$$
\tilde W_t = W_t - \int_0^t H_s ds
$$

then $\tilde W_s$ is a local martingale with respect to $Q$ and $\langle \tilde W \rangle = t$. It can be shown that any process with quadratic variation equating to $t$ is a Brownian motion! 

Using this theorem, we try and define a martingale for $S_t^*$

$$
S_t^* = S_0 \exp (\sigma W_t + (\mu - r - \sigma^2/2)t)
$$

Let $H_t = \theta = \frac{\mu - r}{\sigma}$, then $S^*$ is a martingale with respect to $Q$.
