**Note.** The value of $$\xi(x)$$ for the error calculation depends on the point $$x$$ at which error is being calculated.

### Practical difficulties with Lagrange Polynomials

To use the error form, we need some information about $$f$$ in order to find its derivative. However, this is often not the case. Also, the computations of the lower degree interpolating polynomials does not quite help the computations of the higher degree ones. We would like to find a method that helps in computing the interpolating polynomials cumulatively.

### Cumulative calculation of interpolating polynomials

Let us assume that $$f$$ is given on distinct nodes $$x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n$$. Now, the constant polynomial for the node $$x_0$$ will be $$P_0(x) = f(x_0)$$ and that for the node $$x_1$$ will be $$Q_0(x) = f(x_1)$$. Using Lagrange interpolation, we have


$$
\begin{align}
P_1(x) &= \frac{x - x_1}{x_0 - x_1}f(x_0) + \frac{x - x_0}{x_1 - x_0}f(x_1) \\
&= \frac{(x - x_1)P_0(x) - (x - x_0)Q_0(x)}{(x_0 - x_1)}
\end{align}
$$


Can we generalize this? Let us try to construct the quadratic polynomial. Now, suppose we have $$P_1(x)$$ and $Q_1(x)$. The quadratic polynomial for the nodes $$x_0, x_1, x_2$$ is given by,


$$
\begin{align}
P_2(x) &= \frac{x - x_2}{x_0 - x_2}\left[\frac{x - x_1}{x_0 - x_1}f(x_0) + \frac{x - x_0}{x_1 - x_0}f(x_1)\right] \\
	- &\frac{x - x_0}{x_0 - x_2}\left[\frac{x - x_2}{x_1 - x_2}f(x_1) + \frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1}f(x_2)\right] \\ \\
	&= \frac{(x - x_2)P_1(x) - (x - x_0)Q_1(x)}{x_0 - x_2}
\end{align}
$$


We shall see the general formula in the next lecture.
