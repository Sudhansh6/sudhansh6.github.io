I’m Sudhansh, a second-year Master’s student in Computer Science at <a href="https://ucsd.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">UC San Diego</a>, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I graduated with honors in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IIT Bombay</a>, where I also pursued a minor in Entrepreneurship.</p> <p>I emphasize learning and am deeply curious about exploring new domains and ideas. I enjoy connecting concepts across fields to develop novel algorithms and solve complex problems. I’m passionate about solving challenging problems in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Spatial Computing, particularly in bridging cutting-edge research and real-world applications. My work spans areas like 3D reconstruction, Generative AI, and Statistical Modeling, with a strong emphasis on delivering robust and efficient systems.</p> <div class="container-toggle"> <ul class="nav nav-tabs" id="myTab" role="tablist"> <li class="nav-item" role="presentation"> <a class="nav-link" id="tab-B" data-toggle="tab" href="#content-B" role="tab" aria-controls="content-B" aria-selected="true">Industry</a> </li> <li class="nav-item" role="presentation"> <a class="nav-link active" id="tab-A" data-toggle="tab" href="#content-A" role="tab" aria-controls="content-A" aria-selected="false">Research</a> </li> <li class="nav-item" role="presentation"> <a class="nav-link" id="tab-C" data-toggle="tab" href="#content-C" role="tab" aria-controls="content-C" aria-selected="false">More..</a> </li> </ul> <div class="tab-content" id="myTabContent"> <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="content-A" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-A"> <br> <p> I collaborated with <a href="http://hichristensen.net" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Henrik Christensen</a> on real-time dense 3D SLAM using NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting, integrating these techniques for robot navigation and scene understanding.
