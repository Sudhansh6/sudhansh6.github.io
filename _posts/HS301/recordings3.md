I didn't write the notes for Socrates part.  This is for Plato!

## Plato - Theory of Ideas

Plato integrates epistemology, ontology and ethics. Plato believed that genuine knowledge is changeless, eternal and absolute (Parmenides). The concept of genuine knowledge and sense perception/ reality and appearance. Sophists believed Opinions and Knowledge are one and the same. Plato didn't believe so. 

Plato tried to obtain genuine knowledge using dialectical methods. The Sophists' concept of good varied from time to time. Plato wanted to point this out, and show that their thinking was inconsistent.

Plato's originality lies in the raising the issue of universals ("horseness").  Plato's epistemology raises the issue of universals, and how these universals participate/ relate themselves to particulars. This is the intuition behind "Theory of ideas". Ideas are not known to us, because human knowledge is not absolute according to Parmenides. However, Plato argued that ideas can be grasped using reason - Soul is akin to ideas.

## Plato's Psychology and Ethics

Humans are considered as agents. Plato studies about what motivates these agents to perform actions. Which actions are good or bad? Kind of like the setting for Reinforcement learning.  What is the nature of meaning of the good, and how can we justify such a life to reason? 

## Composition of Agency

An agent is composed of a living body and a soul. The living body decays with time. However, Plato believed soul is immortal. He thought of the body-soul; relation as the myth of a charioteer.

**Reason, Spirit, and Appetite** - Tripartite Relation

- The parts of the soul - Pure Reason - Rational part - Intellectual activities
- The soul enters into the body having moral and irrational part. The irrational part/ spirited part has nobler impulses - Anger, Ambition, Love - Faculty of decision
- Desire on the other hand represents lower appetites/ passion - Appetitive Faculty. Pleasure of senses and pleasure of reason.

The neutral state between pleasure and pain with relation to preceding pain and earlier pleasure - **psychological relativity**.

The body is an impediment of knowledge, from which the soul must free itself to order to behold truth in its purity. According to Plato, every agent must have *self-knowledge* for making good decisions. "All knowledge is reminiscence and all learning is a reawakening". 

The ethical ideal according to Plato is about Justice and Happiness. The soul should not be driven by senses! "The more reasonable the desire, the more pleasurable its gratification".

Moral perfection lies in the power of contemplation and more importantly in the enduring power of truth. One must give importance to the rational element of the soul.
