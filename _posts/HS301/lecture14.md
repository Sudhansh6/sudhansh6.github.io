Dialectic is a form of reasoning. It's the method of connecting different ideas and generalizing stuff. We shall start discussing Aristotle now. Aristotle is the disciple of Plato and the mentor of Alexander the Great. He made significant contributions to science as a discipline. 

Additionally, he formalized the realm of deductive reasoning, a direct extension to Plato's conceptual understanding. Also, *Causal explanation* is another outstanding contribution of Aristotle. Finally, Aristotle believed form and matter are inseparable.

## Aristotle (384 - 322 BC)

He is known for Metaphysics, Syllogism, and Virtue Ethics. Aristotle made a distinction between metaphysics and science.

### Aristotle's Problem

Aristotle believed that the love of wisdom must be the sole aim of philosophers, but they must be consistent and scientific. There was a lack of scientific explanation in Plato's Philosophy which Aristotle sought to address. He questioned Plato's conception of forms/ideas and denied the division between ideas and material.

Ethics is anti-hedonistic and intuitive. Aristotle considered Happiness and Pleasure are different, which is the opposite of what Plato thought. 

> Hedonistic - Engaging in the pursuit of pleasure; sensually self-indulgent

According to Aristotle, form and particulars are not different. Plato doesn't talk about the progressive change of forms as he believed they were eternal. However, Aristotle tried to include change through the "Theory of Causation".

- Forms are not apart from things but inherent in them; they are not transcendent but immanent.
- Form and matter are not separate but eternally together: matter combines with the form to constitute individual things
- The phenomenal world is not a mere imitation or copy/ shadow of the real world. Instead, it is the real world!
- Aristotle advocated realism and encouraged natural science.

The above points summarise how different Aristotle was in comparison to Plato.

## Philosophy and the Sciences

He had an Organic and teleological viewpoint of the universe. Everything in the universe has a purpose, and that is how the world came into being.

>  Teleological - relating to or involving the explanation of  phenomena in terms of the purpose they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise.

He believed experience is the basis of knowledge. Saying that, he thought reason and experience were not significantly different. Genuine knowledge is not mere acquaintance with facts but knowing their reasons and causes. Philosophy and science, in a broad sense, have a rational basis. Science studies the first cause of things.

## Metaphysics

Study of all things as their beings. Analysis of first philosophy. Study of *qua being*.

`How is this different from Ontology?`

A thing is a thing by virtue of something that it is. That is, everything with a form has a function.

## Classification of Sciences

- Logic - Method of inquiry employed in all other sciences
- Theoretical Sciences - Pure abstract knowledge - Maths, Physics, Biology
- Practical Sciences - Knowledge employing conduct - Ethics, Politics
- Productive Sciences - Knowledge is subordinated by the criterion of beauty; Aristotle's *poetics* is an investigation in this sphere of aesthetics.
