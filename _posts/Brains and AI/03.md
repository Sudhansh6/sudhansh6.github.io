It turns out that if you do pattern-matching really well, the internal model evolves into a semantic model of the language. This is what happens in the transformers, and that is what happens in your brain. 

Why is it easier to learn something the second time as compared to the first time?
The learning mechanisms in the brain are overwritten into a superposition kinda state, and these are persistent with time. When you learn different things, there is a spacing effect, wherein the neurons/weights in your head diffuse. However, when you need to relearn it, the changes required are smaller, so itâ€™s faster.

The prevailing knowledge is that all the neurons in your head form when you are born and they die as you grow old. However, from recent research from the Salk institute, it has been found that neurons regenerate in specific regions of the brain. This effect specifically happens in the Dentate Gyrus. These experiments were done by Rusty 30 years ago. 

The LTP of active rats was found to be twice as large as the sedentary rats.
