## Term-rewriting

We have seen 3 computation paradigms

- Turing machine
- Type-0 grammars
- Partial recursive functions

Now, we shall see a 4th paradigm called as term rewriting.

We have **terms** and **domains**. There a few constructors involved with a domain. For example, we have $$0, S$$ for $$N$$. Also, for lists we have $$nl$$ (empty list) and $$\bullet$$ (cons/pipe). We use them as follows

There are also constants ($$0$$) and function symbols/constructors ($$S$$). Termination is guaranteed in normal forms. We also want unique normal form. This will ensure that a term gives a single answer with different recursions (**confluence**). If we get two answers, we call it ill-defined systems.

To understand this better, we shall define $$exp$$.


$$
\begin{align}
exp(x, 0) &= s(0) \\
exp(x, S(y)) &= mult(x, exp(x, y))
\end{align}
$$


$$max$$ is defined as 


$$
\begin{align}
max(0, y) &= y \\
max(S(x), S(y)) &= max(x, y) \\
max(x, 0) &= x \\
\end{align}
$$


### Lists

Suppose we want to define $$app$$. We then have 


$$
\begin{align}
app(nl, y) &= y \\
app(\bullet(x, y), z) &= \bullet(x, app(y, z))
\end{align}
$$


Similarly,


$$
\begin{align}
rev(nl) &= nl \\
rev(\bullet(x, y)) &= app(rev(y), \bullet(x, nl)) 
\end{align}
$$


> ***Homework.*** Show that $$len(x) = len(rev(x))$$

How do we sort a list of numbers?


$$
\begin{align}
sort(nl) &= nl \\
sort(\bullet(x, y)) &= ins(x, sort(y)) \\
ins(x, nl) &= \bullet(x, nl) \\
ins(x, \bullet(y, z)) &= \bullet(\min(x, y), ins(\max(x, y), z))
\end{align}
$$


> ***Homework.*** Try quick sort and merge sort.

### Termination

We have termination on $$N$$ due to $$>$$. How about $$N \times N$$? We use **lexicographic ordering**. One might think it’s not well-founded. This is because $$(9, 1)$$ is greater than $$(5, 1000)$$. However, it is well-founded for finite length tuples. In case of strings, the length need not be finite in lexicographic ordering. Therefore, the ordered list need not be finite. 

> ***Homework.*** Give an ordering rule for multi-sets

### Predicates and Branching

It is easier to express these things in the term-rewriting paradigm. I’m skipping these for brevity.

Can we write $$isPrime$$, $$gcd$$, and $$nth-prime$$? This paradigm naturally develops to Functional Programming. It’s essentially writing everything in terms of functions as we’ve been doing so far.

### Logic Programming

Suppose we give the black-box the input $$x + 3 = 10$$. Can we determine $$x$$? Can we ask multiple answers in case of $$u + v = 10$$? It is possible to do so in logic programming. We do this by <u>passing parameters by unification</u>. That is, we try to convert the parameters $$u, v$$ to look like the parameters given in the rules of $$+$$. This is known as **backtracking**.
