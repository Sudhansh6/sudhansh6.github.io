# Lecture 3 `29-07-21`

Previously, we had discussed about the meaning and nature of philosophy. Philosophy begins with metaphysical inquiry. Science studies about the concrete objects in the universe. On the other hand, philosophy also deals with abstract concepts for knowledge building.

## Order in first Philosophy

Aristotle's philosophy is known as the first philosophy. He discusses about 3 branches of philosophy -

- Science of being *qua being* - ***Ontology*** - General nature of everything. Beings which tentatively exist, and whose understanding is not yet known.
- Highest kind of being - ***Theology*** - Appropriate to divinity.
- First principle - ***Universal science*** - True of every existing thing and lie at the basis of all proof or demonstration. This branch ties together all the concepts.

> Qua - It is a technical expression Aristotle uses to indicate an aspect under which something is to be considered. The study of being 'qua being' concerns the most general class of things, viz., everything that exists.

The **four causes** or four explanations are, in [Aristotelian thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism), four fundamental types of answer to the question "why?" in the [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_Analytics) of change or movement in nature:

- **Material cause**: "that out of which" it is made. God is an *unmoved mover*. According to Aristotle, the primordial "stuff" (fundamental particles) exist at the level of God. How is everything designed? Matter by itself does not have any identity. It gets its purpose from a being who gives it a meaning. 
- **Efficient Cause**: the source of the object's principle of change or stability. 
- **Formal Cause**: the essence of the object. 
- **Final Cause**: the end/goal of the object, or what the object is good for.

Every thing in existence must account for these four causes. 

## The controversial turning points

From the 1950s (BC), there was a dramatic change in the notion of knowledge. Some people (*logical positivists*) gained a scornful attitude towards metaphysics. They considered Metaphysics is meaningless for philosophy.

A philosopher called Gracia talks about how people tried to integrate metaphysics into philosophy. 

"A holistic approach is desirable, but this cannot be reduced to a disorderly aggregate of diverse approaches." (Gracia 2014: 310)

A computer scientist needs to communicate with people who studies metallurgy to better understand the underlying details of the hardware. Similarly, philosophers cannot completely abandon metaphysics for a greater understanding of the reality.

## Epistemology

The term epistemology comes from the Greek words “episteme” and “logos”. “Episteme” can be translated as knowledge or understanding. In contrast, “logos” can be translated as argument or reason.

Knowledge is a justified true belief. Plato's Theatetus - "Knowledge importantly depends on the nature of knower and her relationship to her environment." We can't provide proofs in philosophy. Some scientists try to show philosophy as a field in science.
