Now, we shall study Heraclitus. He was not discussed in the previous years.

## Heraclitus

His ideologies are pretty different from the previous philosophers. Thales talked about a tangible substance - water, and Pythagoras used an intangible substance - Water. Although, they were all natural philosophers - learned about reality from nature.

Heraclitus talks about "Becoming". Being to Becoming. He tried to understand the process of change, transformation, origin, and decay. He used Fire as the first principle. One of his ideas was "Fire lives the death of air, and air lives the death of fire; water lives the death of earth, earth that of water".  He brought upon the concept of **Universal Flux** and cyclical existence.

His ideas can be understood as the primitive version of "Matter can neither be created nor destroyed". There is unity in the world and unity resulting from diversity. The notion of **Logos** - Reason in Things. Logos is also translated as the essence of things. Cosmic process - everything is changing in order; there is nothing arbitrary. He also believed in the concept of soul - cosmic fire. Human thoughts are a subordinate to the Universal Reason or divine reasoning.
