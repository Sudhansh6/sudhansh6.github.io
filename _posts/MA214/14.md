We have


$$
P_n - P_{n - 1} = f[x_0, \dots, x_n](x - x_0)\dots (x - x_{n - 1}) \\ \\
f[x_0, \dots, x_n] = \frac{f[x_1, \dots, x_n] - f[x_0, \dots, x_{n - 1}]}{x_n - x_0}
$$


Since the order of the nodes does not matter, we can traverse the recursion in a forward/backward manner. The forward formula is given by,


$$
P_n(x) = f(x_0) + f[x_0, x_1](x - x_0) + f[x_0, x_1, x_2](x - x_0)(x - x_1) + \\ 
\cdots + f[x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n](x - x_0)\cdots (x - x_{n - 1})
$$


The backward formula simply replaces $$i$$ by $$n - i$$ for $$i \in [0, \dots, n]$$. For clarity, look at the following example.

### Nested form of the interpolating polynomial


$$
P_n(x) = f(x_0) + (x - x_0)\big[f[x_0, x_1] + (x - x_1)[f[x_0, x_1, x_2] + \\
\cdots + (x - x_{n - 1})f[x_0, \dots, x_n]\big]
$$


Neste form of the interpolating polynomial is useful for computing the polynomials $$P_n$$ effectively.

### Divided differences as a function

We now give a definition of the divided differences when some of the nodes may be equal to each other. By the Mean Value Theorem, $$f[x_0, x_1] = f’(\xi)$$ for some $$\xi$$ between  $$x_0$$ and $$x_1$$. In fact, we also have the following theorem,

***Theorem.*** If $$f$$ is $$n$$-times continuously differentiable on $$[a, b]$$ then


$$
f[x_0, \dots, x_n] = \frac{f^{(n)}(\xi)}{n!}
$$


for some $$\xi \in [a, b]$$.

Since $$f[x_0, x_1] = f'(\xi)$$ for some $$\xi$$ between $$x_0$$ and $$x_1$$, we define $$f[x_0, x_0] = f’(x_0) = \lim_{x_1 \to x_0}f[x_0, x_1]$$. Similarly, we define $$f[x_0, \dots, x_n]$$ in a similar way using limits. For instance, 


$$
f[x_0, x_1, x_0] = \frac{f[x_0, x_1]- f'(x_0)}{x_1 - x_0}\\
f[x_0, x_0, x_0] = f^{(2)}(x_0)/2
$$


We have thus defined $$f[x_0, \dots, x_n]$$ in general. Now, by letting the last $$x_n$$ as variable $$x$$, we get a function of x: $$f[x_0, \dots, x_{n - 1}, x]$$. This function is continuous.



$$
f[x_0, x] = \begin{cases}
			\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} & x \neq x_0 \\
			f'(x_0) & x = x_0
		\end{cases}
$$
