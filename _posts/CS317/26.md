If we allow non-unique keys, we can store a key with multiple pointers. However, the complexity comes in terms of deletion. Worst case complexity may be linear.

### $$B^+$$-Tree file Organisation

Leaf nodes in a $$B^+$$ tree file organisation store records, instead of pointers. As records are larger than pointers, the maximum number of records that can be stored in a lead node is less than the number of pointers in a non-leaf node. To improve space utilisation, we can involve more sibling nodes in redistribution during splits and merges. Involving 2 siblings in redistribution results in each node having at least $$\lfloor 2n/3 \rfloor$$ entries.
