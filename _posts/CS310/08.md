## Membership Problem

## Emptiness Problem

Is $$L(M) = \phi$$? This problem can be solved using *reachability* in graphs. One can check if the final states are reachable from the start state. It can be achieved using **fixed point**. This method is essentially propagating the frontier from the start state. We add neighbors of all the states in the current frontier and keep expanding it. We do this until our frontier does not change. This frontier is the fixed point.

## Infiniteness Problem

Is $$L(M)$$ finite? We need to search for a loop in the graph to answer this question. Suppose our DFA has $$N$$ states. If the DFA accepts a string whose length is greater than or equal to $$N$$, then a state has to repeat while forming this string. This observation is a result of the **Pigeonhole principle**.

This check is both necessary and sufficient. If a language is infinite, then it means that it has a string of length greater than $$N$$.

## Pumping Lemma

***Problem.*** Show that $$L = \{a^nb^n\}$$ is not regular. 

We use proof by contradiction. Assume that a $$DFA(M)$$ with $$N$$ states accepts $$L$$.

***Theorem.*** *Pumping Lemma*. For every regular language $$L$$, there is an integer $$n$$, such that for every string $$w$$ in $$L$$ of length $$\geq N$$, we can write $$w = xyz$$ such that


$$
\begin{align}
\vert xy \vert &\leq n \\
\vert y\vert &> 0\\
\forall i \geq 0,\ &  xyz \in L
\end{align}
$$
