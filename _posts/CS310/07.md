> ***Homework.*** Draw a DFA for the language $$L_1 \cup L_2$$ where $$L_1$$ is $$a$$ followed by even number of $$b$$s and $$L_2$$ is $$a$$ followed by odd number of $$c$$s.

## Regular Expressions

The base cases for regular expressions are given as follows.
$$
L(a) = \{a\} \\
L(\epsilon) = \{\epsilon\} \text{ - An empty set} \\
L(\phi) = \phi
$$
***`TODO - Proof of RE to NFA-`$\epsilon$***.
