**Lemma:** $$X, Y$$ are independent martingales, then $$X_tY_t$$ is a martingale. Applies to local martingale as well

*Proof.* Let $$W = (W^1, \dots, W^n)$$ be an $$n$$-dimensional Brownian motion. 

$$
\begin{align*}
M_t &= \int_0^t H_s \cdot DdW \\
N_t &= \int_0^t K_s \cdot dW \\
\langle M_t, N_T \rangle &:= \int_0^t \sum_i (H_s^i K_s^i) ds \\
&= \int_0^t H_s \cdot K_s ds 
\end{align*}
$$

To show $$\mathbb E[X_t Y_t \cdot 1_C] = \mathbb E[X_s Y_s \cdot 1_C]$$. Let $$\mathcal F_t^X = \sigma(X_S: s \leq t), \mathcal F_t^Y = \sigma(Y_s: s \leq t)$$. Then $$\mathcal F_t^{X, Y} = \sigma(\mathcal F_t^X, \mathcal F_t^Y)$$

This is true for $$C = A \cap B$$ for $$A \in \mathcal F_s^X, B \in F_S^Y$$. From Monotone Class Theorem, if such a relation is true on the Pi class (closed under intersection), then it is true for all $$C$$.

**Corollary.** $$\langle X, Y \rangle \equiv 0$$

With these results, we can now work with multiple stocks ($$d$$) using the Black-Scholes equation with underlying $$n$$-Brownian motion.

Consider this example - -$$d = 1, n = 2, r = 0$$. We have $$dS_t = S_t(\beta dt + g(Z_t)dW_t^1), S_0 > 0$$ where $$dZ_t  = Z_t (\gamma dt + \delta dW_t^2), Z_0 = 1$$, $$\beta, \gamma \in \mathbb R, \delta > 0, g(x) \geq \epsilon > 0$$.

**Claim.** There exists at least one ELMM but this market is not complete.

*Proof.* Choose a martingale

$$
M_T^\theta := -\int_0^t \frac{\beta}{g(Z_s)} dW_s' + \theta W_t^2
$$

for $$\theta \in \mathbb R$$. The density process is chosen as $$\Lambda_t = \exp(M_t^\theta - \frac{1}{2} \langle M^\theta \rangle_t)$$ as suggested by the Girsanov's theorem. Now, we need to show two things - $$M_t^\theta$$ is a martingale and $$\Lambda_t$$ satisfied Novikov's condition.

$$M_t^\theta$$ is a local martingale because the individual terms in the expression are martingales. The quadratic variation of $$M_t^\theta$$ is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle M^\theta \rangle_t &= \int_0^t \frac{\beta^2}{g(Z_s)^2}ds + \theta^2 t \\
&\leq \frac{\beta^2}{\epsilon^2}t + \theta ^2 t
\end{align*}
$$

Since the quadratic variation of $$M_t^\theta$$ is bounded by a constant, $$M_t^\theta$$ is a martingale. Also, from Novikov's condition, $$\Lambda_t$$ is a martingale as well.

Now, according to  Girsanov's theorem,

$$
\begin{align*}
\tilde W_t^1 &= W_t^1 - \langle W^1, M^\theta\rangle_t  \\
&= W_t^1 + \int_0^t \frac{\beta}{g(Z_s)}ds
\end{align*} 
$$

is a $$Q^\theta$$-Brownian motion.

From the previous result, $$\tilde W^2_t = W_t^2 - \theta t$$ is a $$Q$$-Brownian motion.

$$
\begin{align*}
dS_t &= S_t (\beta dt- g(Z_t)dW') \\
&= S_t g(Z_t) d \tilde W'_t 
\end{align*}
$$

So, $$S_t$$ is a $$Q^\theta$$-local martingale, implying that $$Q^\theta$$ is a ELMM. 

Now, to show that the market is not complete, we'll explicitly construct a martingale that cannot be replicated. Letting $$\theta = 0$$, we get $$\tilde W_T^2 = W_T^2$$. To replicate it, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
\tilde W_t^2 = \int_0^t \alpha_u dS_u \\

\end{align*}
$$

Let us now calculate the quadratic variation - 

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle \tilde W^2 \rangle_t &= t \quad \because Q\text{-Brownian motion} \\
&= \langle \tilde W^2, \tilde W^2 \rangle_t = \langle  \tilde W^2, \int_0^t \alpha_u S_u g(Z_s) d \tilde W_u' \rangle _t \\
&= \int_0^t \alpha_u S_u g(Z_u) d \langle \tilde W^2, \tilde W^1 \rangle_u = 0 
\end{align*}

$$

because $$\langle \tilde W^2, \tilde W' \rangle_t = \langle W^2, W^1 \rangle_t = 0$$. This is a contradiction, and therefore, the market cannot be replicated.
