## Lecture 1 - Introduction

We will start by studying Western (Classical Greek) philosophy. In particular, we shall look into Thales, Pythagoras, and Heraclitus's philosophy.

Moving further, we enter the Socratic period. Here, we shall study Socrates (obviously), Plato, and Aristotle.

Then, we shall learn about Modern Philosophy - Thomas Hobbes and Rene Descartes (Why are we studying mathematicians?).

We will also look into Indian Philosophy. It consists of 6 major realms, but we will cover Charvaka, Samkhya (Numbers?), and Buddhism.

From what I understand, we will read a book called "The Courage to Exist: A Philosophy of Life and Death in the Age of Coronavirus" by Ramin Jahanbegloo. Reading the book will reduce the syllabus in Modern philosophy.

### What is Philosophy?

**Philosophy** is a humanistic discipline. Philosophy is related to human life. This relation is ***epistemological***. By epistemology, we mean study of knowledge - theory of knowledge. Its epistemological relation unfolds human aspiration for higher knowledge concerning the reality, or the ***underlying principle of the reality***.

The underlying principle of human existence or the existence of the entire cosmos or the reality brings out the discourse on ***metaphysics***. Philosophy in fact began with metaphysics. Philosophical inquiry was metaphysical inquiry.

Does something exist or not? Is something meaningful or not? Philosophy is an endless quest for gaining an understanding of reality. Humans have cultivated the value of seeking knowledge. **Metaphysics** talks about what really exists in the universe. [Thales](http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/thales.html) theorised *water* is the fundamental element of the universe.
