### Natural Join

Natural join matches tuples with the same values for all common attributes, and retains only one copy of each common column.

> Can't do self-join using this?

However, one must be beware of natural join because ir produces unexpected results.

### Outer join

One can lose information with inner join and natural join. Outer join is an extension of the join operation that avoids loss of information. Outer join uses `null` to fill the incomplete tuples. We have variations of outer join such as left-outer join, right-outer join, and full outer join.

Can outer join be expressed using relational algebra? Yes, think about it.
