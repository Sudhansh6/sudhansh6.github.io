This domain is essential for solving future problems and also making the current architectures more efficient. This is crucial considering that companies are reactivating nuclear power plants to power AI in the real-world.</p> <p>Along with the progress in AI from small neural networks to large language models, there has been a development in the size of datasets as well. Big data arrived, and AI today relies on these internet-scale datasets. After all, doesn’t ChatGPT just do pattern-matching in the internet?</p> <p>Moreover, the compute capabilities have been scaling exponentially. Just last year (2024), NVIDIA released a new super-chip architecture <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Blackwell</a> that has 97 billion transistors that can reach up to 1.4 exa-flops! The largest super-computer was barely able to reach 1 exa-flop. All this power in the palm of your hand…</p> <p>Richard Sutton once said, search and learning can scale unparalleled with growing computation power.</p> <p>Consider the year 2012 — AlexNet made waves showing SOTA capabilities with images. They use Stochastic Gradient Descent, dropout, convolution networks and initialization techniques. Without ML systems (CUDA, etc), the code would have been 44,000 lines with days of training! With these systems (Jax, PyTorch, TensorFlow) in place, you can achieve the same result in 100 lines within hours of training.</p> <h3 id="in-practice">In Practice</h3> <p>In industry, problems are typically of the form - improve the self-driving car’s pedestrian detection to be X-percent accurate at Y-ms latency budget. For an ML engineer is, the general approach is to design a better model with better learning efficiency followed by hyper-parameter running, pruning, distillation. An ML systems engineer would take the best model by ML researchers, specialize the implementation to target the H/W platform to reduce latency. <em>Streamlining the entire process from development to deployment</em>.</p> <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2> <p>From ad-hoc methods having diverse models and optimization algorithms with various data pre-processing techniques - we have arrived at an optimal algorithm that is <em>iterative and convergent</em>. As our models have become more and more specialized, the computation resources scaled exponentially.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17363053041704.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Through the course of this article, we will cover deep learning basics, computational graphs, Autodiff, ML frameworks, GPUs, CUDA and collective communication.</p> <p>There are more related topics to the ones discussed here</p> <ul> <li>ML for systems</li> <li>ML Hardware design</li> </ul> <p>Unfortunately, the textbook for this content is just miscellaneous research papers.</p> <h1 id="background">Background</h1> <h2 id="dl-computation">DL Computation</h2> <p>The idea is to concatenate composable layers</p> \[\theta^{(t + 1)} = f(\theta^{(t)}, \nabla_L(\theta^{(t)}, D^{(t)})\] <p>A <strong>model</strong> is a parameterized function that describes how we map inputs to predictions. The parameters are optimized using optimization methods like <strong>SGD</strong>, Newton methods, etc. A <strong>loss function</strong> guides the model to give feedback on how well the model is performing.</p> <p>Having these basic definitions, we will build abstractions to map all the models being used today. It is not possible to build systems to support all models. A quick refresher of important models</p> <ul> <li> <strong>CNNs</strong> - Learnable filters to convolute across images to learn spatial features. The top 3 breakthrough architectures were - AlexNet, ResNet, U-Net. What are the important components in CNNs? <ul> <li>Convolution (1D, 2D, 3D)</li> <li>Matmul</li> <li>Softmax</li> <li>Element-wise operations - ReLU, add, sub, pooling, normalization, etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Recurrent Neural Networks</strong> - Many problems in nature are many-to-many. RNNs maintain an internal state that is updated as a sequence is processed. Arbitrary inputs and outputs can be generated, and any neural network can be used in the RNN architecture. The top 3 breakthrough architectures were - Bidirectional RNNs, LSTMs, GRU. What are the important components in RNNs? <ul> <li>Matmul</li> <li>Element-wise non-linear - ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh</li> <li>Underlying MLP RNNs have a problem of forgetting (\(0.9*0.9*… \approx 0\)). Additionally, they lack <strong>parallelizability</strong> - both forward and backward passes have \(O(sequence length)\).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Transformers</strong> (Attention + MLP) - Treat representations of each element in the sequences as queries to access and incorporate information from a set of values. Transformers have an encoder part (BERT most famous) and a decoder part (GPT most famous). Along with these, DiT is one of the top 3 models. What are the important components in Transformers? <ul> <li>Attention - Matmul, softmax, Normalization</li> <li>MLP</li> <li>Layernorm, GeLU, etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Mixture of Experts</strong> - Voting from many experts is better than one expert. Latest LLMs are mostly MoEs - Grok, Mixtral, Deepseek-v3. A router (Matmul, softmax) is the novel component in MoE - it makes system design difficult.</li> </ul> <h2 id="machine-learning-systems">Machine Learning Systems</h2> <p>As mentioned before, the three pillars for the systems are data, model and compute. The foal is to express as manny as models as possible using one set of programming interface by connecting math primitives.</p> <h3 id="computational-dataflow-graph">Computational Dataflow Graph</h3> <p>A representation to show data flow in programs. A <strong>node</strong> represents the computation (operator) and an <strong>edge</strong> represents the data dependency (data flowing direction).

However, creating such a graph doesn’t allow flexibility - once a graph is defined, it cannot be changed based on the input.</p> <h3 id="example-pytorch">Example: PyTorch</h3> <p>PyTorch also uses computational graphs, but it creates it on the fly. Previously, we had defined the graph and then executed it. Symbolic declaration vs imperative programming. Define-then-run vs Define-and-run. C++ vs Python.</p> <p>What are the pros and cons?</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th> </th> <th>Good</th> <th>Bad</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Symbolic</td> <td>Easy to optimize, much more efficient (can be 10x faster)</td> <td>The way of programming can be counter-intuitive, hard to debug and less flexible</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Imperative</td> <td>More flexible, easy to program and debug</td> <td>Less efficient and more difficult to optimize</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>How does TensorFlow work in Python then? Tensorflow has Python as the interface language.</p> <p>Apart from these two famous frameworks, there were more like Caffe, DyNet, mxnet (has ability to switch between both), etc. Recently, Jax (derived from Tensorflow) has been getting more popular.</p> <h3 id="just-in-time-jit-compilation">Just-in-time (JIT) compilation</h3> <p>Ideally, we want define-and-run during development and define-then-run during deployment. However do we combine both? PyTorch introduced a deploy mode through a decorator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.compile()</code>. So is there an issue with JIT? It creates only static graphs, and cannot work with conditionals or loops in the code.</p> <h3 id="static-vs-dynamic-models">Static vs Dynamic models</h3> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17364797895738.jpg" alt=""> Static graphs are defined and optimized only once. The execution follows a defined computation. On the other hand, dynamic graphs depend on the input. It is difficult to express complex flow-control logic and debug. The implementation is also difficult.</p> <p>As seen above, LSTMs are trying to replace the dynamics in the natural language problem.</p> <p><strong>How to handle dynamics?</strong></p> <ul> <li>Just do Define-and-run and forget about JIT - most popular unforunately :(</li> <li>Introduce Control Flow Ops - <ul> <li>Example: Switch and Merge. This can be added a computational primitive in the graph and introduce dynamics in the graph.</li> <li>These ideas are natural across all programming languages - conditionals and loops. However, the problem with this approach is that graphs becomes complex, and more importantly, how does we do back propagation? What is the gradient of “switch”? TensorFlow team has been working on this.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Piecewise compilation and guards - This approach is better adopted than control flow. <ul> <li>Case 1: A graph accepting input shapes of \([x, c1, c2]\) where \(x\) is variable. The solution is to compile for different values of \(x\) (powers of 2).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>So far, we have seen representations that express the forward computations using primitives. But, how do we represent backward computations?</p> <h1 id="autodiff-ad">Autodiff (AD)</h1> <p>Derivative can be taken using the first order principles. However, this approach can be slow since we have to evaluate the function twice \(f(\theta + \epsilon) , f(\theta)\) and it is also error prone \(\theta(\epsilon^2)\).</p> <p>To optimize the derivative calculation, we pre store the gradients of primitives and map the derivative chain rules in the computational graph. There are two ways of doing this as well</p> <ol> <li>Calculating the derivative from left (inside) to right (outside) in a network - from inputs to outputs</li> <li>Calculating it from right to left - from outputs to inputs</li> </ol> <p>Both are valid approaches and we will discuss them in detail.</p> <h2 id="forward-mode-autodiff">Forward Mode Autodiff</h2> <p>We start from the input nodes, and derive the gradients all the way to the output nodes. <strong>Cons</strong> - - For \(f: R^n \to R^k\), we need \(n\) forward passes to get the gradients with respect to each input. - However, it is usually the case that \(k = 1\) (loss) and \(n\) is very large.</p> <blockquote> <p>If this is confusing, think of it this way - we want the gradient of output with respect to all parameters to update weights. However, forward mode calculates the gradient of inputs with respect to all parameters.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="reverse-mode-autodiff">Reverse Mode Autodiff</h2> <p>We define the quantity <em>adjoint</em> \(\bar v_i = \frac{\partial y}{\partial v_i}\). We then compute each \(\bar v_i\) in the reverse topological order of the graph. This way, we can simply do one backward pass to get the necessary gradients.</p> <p>In some scientific scenarios, we can have \(k &gt;&gt; n\) where the forward mode can be more efficient.</p> <blockquote> <p>What are the size bounds of the backward graph as compared to the neural network?</p> </blockquote> <p>We construct backward graphs in a symbolic way to reuse it multiple times.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17369099776396.jpg" alt=""></p> <h2 id="backpropagation-vs-reverse-mode-ad">Backpropagation vs. Reverse-mode AD</h2> <p>In old frameworks like Caffe/cuda-convnet, the backward computations were done through the forward graph itself. Newer frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch construct the backward graph explicitly. The reasons to do so are -</p> <ol> <li>Explicit graphs allow backward computation with any input values. They have flexibility to even calculate gradient of gradients.</li> <li>Having an explicit backward graph can help optimization!</li> <li>Gradient update rules can be efficiently implemented.</li> </ol> <h2 id="gradient-update-rules">Gradient update rules</h2> <p>Typically done via gradient descent, the weights are updated with the gradients with the following simplified rule</p> \[f(\theta, \nabla_l) = \theta - \eta \nabla_L\] <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17369103443367.jpg" alt=""></p> <h1 id="architecture-overview-of-ml-systems">Architecture Overview of ML systems</h1> <p>The aim is to make the systems fast, scalable, memory-efficient, run on diverse hardware, energy efficient and easy to program/debug/deploy. Phew.</p> <p>We have discussed dataflow and Autodiff graphs. However, there are numerous things that can be added to these - graph optimization, parallelization, runtime memory, operator optimizations and compilation.</p> <h2 id="graph-optimization">Graph Optimization</h2> <p>The goal is to rewrite the original graph \(G\) as \(G’\) that is faster.</p> <p>Consider the following motivating example - Typically, convolution is followed by batch normalization. Instead of performing batch normalization, just update the weights in convolution to do everything in one step!</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17369110087495.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Note that some steps can become slower based on the hardware, but you get the general idea.</p> <p>Similarly, in attention calculations, the code is typically written with a concatenated vector of queries, keys and values. This version is optimal - it can be understood with <em>Arithmetic Intensity</em> which the ratio of #operations and #bytes. For example, an addition operation has intensity of \(1/3\) (2 loads and one store). However, fusing multiple arithmetic operations reduces the loads and stores by bringing all variables into memory once, improving the arithmetic intensity.</p> <h3 id="so-how-do-we-optimize-graphs">So how do we optimize graphs?</h3> <p>We write rules or templates for opportunities to simplify graphs. There is also implementation of <em>auto-discovering</em> optimizations in the latest libraries, we shall study these.</p> <h2 id="parallelization">Parallelization</h2> <p>The goal is to parallelize the graph computation over multiple devices. Note that devices can be connected with fast (memory communication NVLink) and slow connections (across GPUs), with up to 10x performance difference. Ideally, we do not want to describe partitioning rules for every new model that comes up. Based on these communication patterns, distributing the tasks is not an easy problem. So, we shall discuss how we partition the computational graph on a device cluster.</p> <h2 id="runtime-and-scheduling">Runtime and Scheduling</h2> <p>How do we schedule the compute, communication and memory in a way that execution is as fast as possible, communication is overlapped with compute and is subject to memory constraints?</p> <h2 id="operator-implementations">Operator Implementations</h2> <p>The goal is this layer is to get the fastest possible implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matmul</code>s, for different hardware, different precision and different shapes.</p> <p>NVIDIA releases a GPU every 2 years, and they have rewrite all operations every time! Notably, previously, models were trained using 32-bit floating points, but now researchers are emphasizing on lower and lower precisions.</p> <p>Now, we shall delve into each of these architectures.</p> <h1 id="operator-optimization-and-compilation">Operator Optimization and Compilation</h1> <p>The goal is maximize arithmetic intensity. In general there are three ways to speed up operators</p> <h3 id="vectorization">Vectorization</h3> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17369120762344.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The right version is faster because of the hardware - cache sizes, etc. Tensorflow and PyTorch have this built-in.</p> <h3 id="refactoring-data-layout">Refactoring data layout</h3> <p>This is again related to how data is stored in memory. For example, C++ stores matrices in row-major order. Accessing columns of a matrix can be 10x slower! Remember this while writing code to lower cache misses and reduce pointer movements.</p> <p>ML systems don’t store tensors in row or column major but in a new format called <strong>strides format</strong> - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A[i, j, …] = A.data[offset + i*A.strides[0] + j*A.strides[1] + …</code>. It is a generalization of row and column major storage, and it offers more flexibility - so based on the batch-sizes or other parameters in a neural network.</p> <p>Strides can separate the underlying storage and the view of the tensor. Consider the following operations</p> <ol> <li> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slice</code> - simply changing the offsets and shape will output the slice without any copying involved.</li> <li> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transpose</code> - modifying strides will transpose the tensor without any copying! For example, consider the following example <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     <span class="n">M</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">strides</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1"># (24, 12, 4, 1)
</span>     <span class="n">M</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">permute</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="n">M</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">strides</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1"># (12, 4, 1, 24)
</span></code></pre></div> </div> </li> <li> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">broadcast</code> - Suppose we have to extend a tensor’s data across a dimension for performing operations with another tensor, then by simply adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> stride in the appropriate dimensions would be enough! Again, no copying</li> </ol> <p>Many more operations can be done without copying the data and simply modifying the strides. For example, consider the following example -</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17370816868291.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>However, strides also has an issue - Memory access may become non-contiguous, and many vectorized ops require continuous storage.</p> <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3> <p>To make operators efficient, we have seen the following tactics -</p> <ol> <li>Vectorization - leverage platform-specific vectorized functions that reduce seek time</li> <li>Data layout - strides format that allow zero-copies enabling fast array-manipulations</li> <li>Parallelization on CPUs</li> </ol> <p>These were techniques for general operations. However, we can optimize certain operators with their special properties.</p> <h3 id="matmul-optimization">Matmul optimization</h3> <p>The brute-force approach takes \(\mathcal O(n^3)\). The best approach humans know is \(\mathcal O(n^{2.371552})\)!</p> <p>How to improve the speed in practice then? Recall that we are trying to increase AI = #ops/#bytes.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Memory Hierarchy</strong> If everything ran on registers, things would be super-fast. But, that is expensive. Remember that L1-Cache has 0.5ns latency, L2-Cache has 7ns and DRAM has 200ns (400x slower!)</p> </blockquote> <p>Let us analyze the AI of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matmul</code> considering the different layers of memory</p> <ol> <li>We can directly move data to registers in every iteration in inner loop</li> </ol> <h2 id="gpus-and-accelerators">GPUs and accelerators</h2> <p>Recall that parallelizing operations across threads is super useful! CPUs have some level of parallelism through SIMD operations (vectorization) but they are limited. Building on the same idea, GPUs were born.</p> <p>When we started out, the ALU units were limited by the physical space on the chips. As technology improved, we moved from 70nm process all the way 3nm process! That is, we can fit up to 20x more cores in the same area! The majority of the area on CPUs is consumed by Control and Cache, and Jensen thought, ditch those and put cores.</p> <p>Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) are tailored for matrix or tensor operations. The basic idea is to use tons of ALUs (weak but specialized) with massive parallelism (SIMD on steroids).</p> <p>There are other hardware accelerators like Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) or Application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), etc. The common theme across all these is the same - there are specialized cores.

The arithmetic intensity is then \(\frac{\text{\#compute operations}}{\text{\#I/O operations}} = \frac{2mnp}{mn + np + mp}\).

</code></pre></div></div> <p>The host code launched a grid of CUDA blocks, which then call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matrixAdd</code> kernel. The function definition starts with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__global__</code> which denotes a CUDA kernel function that runs of the GPU. Each thread indexes its data using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blockIdx</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blockDim</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">threadIdx</code> and execute the compute. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that the job is correctly partitioned and the memory is handled correctly.</p> <p>The host code has a serial execution. However, the device code has SIMD parallel execution on the GPUs. When the kernel is launched, the CPU program <em>continues executing</em> without <em>halting</em> while the device code runs on the GPU. Due to this design, it is important that the device code does not have any return values - causes erroneous behavior. To get results from the GPU, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUDA.synchronize</code> is used (an example will be shown later).</p> <p>It is the developers responsibility to map the data to blocks and threads. The blockDim, shapes etc should be statically declared. This is the reason why compilers like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.compile</code> requires static shapes. The CUDA interface provides a CPU/GPU code separation to the users.</p> <p>The SIMD implementation has a constraint for the control flow execution - it requires all ALUs/cores to process in the same pace. In a control flow, not all ALUs may do useful work and it can lead to up to 8 times lower peak performance.</p> <h3 id="coherent-and-divergent-execution">Coherent and Divergent execution</h3> <p>A coherent execution applied the same instructions to all data. Divergent executions do the opposite and they need to be minimized in CUDA programs. This distinction is important to note - even the latest models like the LLMs have this behavior. Concepts such as attention masking and sliding window attention are examples of divergent behavior and they need to be specially implemented to extract the most compute from the GPU.</p> <h2 id="cuda-memory-model">CUDA Memory model</h2> <p>CUDA device (SIMD execution on GPU) has its own memory called the <em>HBM</em>.</p> <p>Unlike host (CPU) memory that is stored as pages in the RAM, GPU memory does not use pages but has memory pools (bulk data) that are accessed all at once.</p> <p>Memory can be allocated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cudaMalloc</code> and populated with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cudaMemcpy</code> like usual. CUDA has a concept called <strong>pinned memory</strong> that is part of the host memory which is optimized for data transfer between CPU/GPU. Ig is not pagable by the OS and is locked, and only certain APIs can access it.</p> <p>Every thread has its own private memory space, and every block has a shared memory that all its threads can access. The HBM is the global device memory in the GPU that can be accessed by all threads. The memory complexity is to balance between speed and shared memory parallelism.</p> <p>For example, consider the program for window averaging -</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nf">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">):</span>

Basically, the language is automating some parts (like compilers), and making the design process simpler for users (as compared to CUDA). These design philosophies are important because they help build newer mental models for users - because they offload some of the cognitive load for optimization, they can think of newer ways of optimizing with these restricted set of parameters. Consider the example of softmax calculation. This function would be slow if implemented using primitives. PyTorch implements an end-to-end kernel for softmax to increase its performance.

It takes up to 5 minutes to verify 750 substitutions and there are about 45 rules for the operators which takes about 10 minutes.

It was a compiler for rendering, but since the workflow is very similar to neural networks, the later compilers draw motivation from here.</p> <p>Then came XLA in 2016-17, that has good performance but had very difficult to understand code. Companies tried other operations such as TensorRT, cuDNN and ONNX for template based graph substitution. CuDNN is still popularly used but no one understands the code since it was written in a very low level language.</p> <p>Then came <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tvm</code> in 2018 that we’ve discussed before. In 2019-20, MLIR and Flexflow were introduced - these are layers in the compiler that provided specific optimizations. Then came 2.0 and Torch Dynamo.</p> <p>However, the community is shifting away from compilers. Why? One part is that many optimizations have been found. The main reason is that we’ve seen a certain class of neural networks architectures that work really well. For example, transformers are all the rage. So instead of focusing on compilers, people can focus on just building fused kernels for the attention mechanisms. That’s how we got flash-attention that no compiler is able to beat.</p> <h1 id="runtime">Runtime</h1> <h2 id="memory-and-scheduling">Memory and Scheduling</h2> <p>Our goal is to fit the workload on limited memory and ensure that the peak memory usage is less than the available memory.</p> <blockquote> <p>Need to add some stuff here.</p> </blockquote> <p>Consider the GPT-3 architecture -</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17382918001192.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>For every model, we check the precision and multiply the number of parameters by 2 or 4 to calculate the total memory consumption.</p> <p>For the main model with 175B parameters, if each parameter is 2 bytes, then we require 350Gb of memory! How did we make this work?</p> <p>Why does this rule of thumb work? Let us check the activation sizes for different layers</p> <ol> <li>For 2D convolution: The input has the size \((bs, nc, wi, hi)\), and the output has \((bs, nc, wo, ho)\). The activation size is \(bs*nc*wo*ho*\text{sizeof(element)}\)</li> <li>For an MLP with input size \((bc, m, n)\) and output size \((bs, m, p)\), the activation size is \(bs*m*p*\text{sizeof(element)}\)</li> <li>For a transformer (ignoring activation layers and other FFLs) - the input size is \((bs, h, seq\_len)\) and the output size is \((bs, h, seq\_len). The activation size is\)bs<em>h</em>seq_len*\text{sizeof(element)}$$</li> </ol> <p>So for GPT-3, the per-layer activation assuming sequence length 1 comes to 78 or 156 Gb. Let us add some more elements to this calculation.</p> <p>The Adam Optimizer estimates the first and second moment vectors with parameters for exponential decays. It also has a step-size or learning rate. The algorithm is given by</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17382924545817.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Along with the learning rate, since it also stores the moments, it has to store two more values for each parameter! The memory usage becomes thrice of what it should be!</p> <h3 id="lifetime-of-activations-at-training">Lifetime of activations at training</h3> <p>Because we need to store the intermediate values for the gradient steps, training an \(N\)-layer neural network would require \(O(N)\) memory. This is the main difference between training and inference. In inference, we wouldn’t need to store the parameters at all layers, so we would just need \(O(1)\) memory.</p> <p>So we’ve seen for GPT-3, we require 350 or 700 Gb. So for a sequence length of 96, we would require 7488 or 14976 Gb! These numbers are just crazy! We haven’t even considered the composite layers.</p> <p>Therefore, it is important to take care of memory.</p> <h3 id="single-device-execution">Single Device execution</h3> <p>How do we reduce the memory usage?</p> <p>Idea 1 - the input or the activation is not needed until the backward pass reaches the layer. So, we can discard some of them and recompute the missing intermediate nodes in small segments. This technique is called <em>recomputation, rematerialization, checkpoint activation, etc</em>. It’s essentially the time-space tradeoff.</p> <p>For an \(N\) layer neural network, if we checkpoint every \(K\) layers, then the memory cost reduces to</p> \[\text{Memory cost} = \mathcal O\left(\frac{N}{K}\right) + \mathcal O(K)\] <p>To minimize this, we can pick \(K = \sqrt{N}\). The total recomputation increases by \(N\) - essentially another forward pass. In PyTorch, this feature can be activated using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.utils.checkpoint</code>.</p> <p>So when do we use this? When memory is a constraint and time of training is not a concern. The memory usage also depends on the layer being checkpointed - the layers can have different out sizes. In transformers, the layer boundary is typically checkpointed. The disadvantage is that this only works for activations.</p> <blockquote> <p>why?</p> </blockquote> <p>The second idea is <strong>gradient accummulation</strong>. The activation memory is linear to batch size. The idea is to compute the gradient for the batch but will limited memory. We split the original batch into micro-batches and accumulate the gradients at each layer. We then update the weights for the complete batch.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17382936900407.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The disadvantage of this strategy is that over-subscribing of GPUs is difficult since we have smaller matrices.</p> <p>An alternative method to save on GPU memory is to use the memory hierarchy. We have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SwapIn</code> (swap from CPU DRAM to HBM) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SwapOut</code> (swap from HBM to CPU DRAM) that can be applied to both weights and activation. As we do a forward pass, we swap in the next layers and swap out the passed layers. You can be a bit more intelligent about it and pre-fetch the layers based on the computation and swap latencies. This strategy is becoming more practical as more companies are adopting the unified memory architecture. The memory hierarchy seems to be breaking.</p> <p>All these strategies can be used together to probably train GPT-3 on a single device but it would take forever.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17387232533206.jpg" alt=""> Why do we start with gradient accumulation instead of gradient checkpointing? Checkpointing greatly increases the computation time, so we try the other alternatives first.</p> <h2 id="memory-and-compute">Memory and Compute</h2> <h3 id="quantization">Quantization</h3> <p>All our memory usage is a multiple of \(\text{sizeof(element)}\). What if we reduce that parameter?</p> <p>Quantization is the process of constraining an input from a continuous or otherwise large set of value to a discrete set. We use a lower-precision representation for data while preserving ML performance (accuracy), speeding up compute, reducing memory, saving energy, etc. Most of the edge models use quantization.</p> <p>To understand this better, let’s understand the representation of data in memory -</p> <ul> <li>An unsigned integer has the range \([0, 2^n - 1]\)</li> <li>A signed integer with \(n\)-bit has the range \([-2^{n-1} - 1, 2^{n - 1} - 1]\). To avoid saving 0 twice by storing a sign bit, computer architects decided to use <em>Two’s complement representation</em>.</li> <li>Fixed point number - An arbitrary bit is chosen as the boundary for the integer and the decimal. This representation is mainly used in security applications now.</li> <li> <p>Floating point representation - We use a sign bit, 8-bit exponent and 23 bit fraction. That is the value is, \((-1)^{sign} \times (1 + \text{ fraction}) \times 2^{\text{exponent} - 127}\).</p> <p>How do we represent 0 then? Representation-wise, we technically cannot represent 0, so we make a special representation - <em>normal vs subnormal values</em>. Whenever the exponent bits are zero, we remove the bias term \(1\) that is added to the fraction, and represent the value as \((-1)^{sign} \times \text{ fraction} \times 2^{\text{exponent} - 127}\). This expressions is only used with the exponent is \(0\). This way, we also extend the range of the representation and the smallest positive number we can represent is \(2^{-149}\).</p> <p>How about special values? Exponent with all set bits is infinity and sign is decided by the sign bit. NaN is represented in the subnormal range with exponent bits set to 1. In summary, we have</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17387239819544.jpg" alt=""></p> </li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Calculate model sizes from parameters table.</p> </blockquote> <p>Notice that the precision of floating point numbers is much higher when the values themselves are small. This is a tradeoff we make based on the applications. Here is a summary of other floating point representations -</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17387241256605.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The BF16 system has been observed to provide much better performance over FP16 for neural network training. The representation lowers the precision for a higher range. It could be that the higher range can stabilize the training during exploding or vanishing gradients. During inference, the precision matters more so FP16 might perform better in some cases.</p> <p>For practice, consider the following examples</p> <ul> <li>The FP16 bit set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 10001 1100000000</code> represents -7.1. Why? The bias in the exponent is always the median value subtracted by 1. Here it is \(2^4 - 1 = 15\).

The bias is \(2^7 - 1 = 127\)</li> </ul> <p>After these representations, newer ones came up to improve the performance in deep-learning. <img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17387248528126.jpg" alt=""> The rule of thumb is that we require higher range for training and higher precision for inference.</p> <p>As if this were not enough, for even lower compute, NVIDIA has been pushing for INT4 and FP4 to keep up with the Moore’s law.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17387250679255.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>There has been no successful model with these representations, making it a very promising avenue for research.</p> <p>Alright, with these things in mind, let us come back to quantization. There have been two approaches for quantization</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>K-Means based quantization</strong> - widely used, almost all mobile devices have it.</p> <p>Consider we have a weight matrix that we are trying to quantize. The idea is to cluster close values together into an integer or a lower-precision representation. The number of clusters is chosen based on the chosen requirements - for 2-bit quantization, number of clusters is 4.<br> To do so, we simply apply K-means. The centroids are stored in a code book whereas the matrix is simply stored in the lowest possible representation to further reduce storage. <img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17387254097673.jpg" alt=""> How do we perform a backward pass on these matrices? The gradients are accumulated based on the classes and are applied to the centroids to fine-tune them. In practice, quantization starts affecting the performance sharply only after a certain threshold. Therefore, quantization becomes a hyper-parameter tuning problem, and we can achieve significantly lower memory consumption. The number of bits used can vary with layers as well!</p> <blockquote> <p>Try coding a library with variable quantization layers. Shared code books across layers</p> </blockquote> <p>How is the run-time affected? The computations are still FP arithmetic. There is an added computation cost for weight compression/decompression and code book lookup. K-means has been quite effective with convolution networks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Linear quantization</strong> - The idea is to determine a linear mapping of integers to real numbers. It can be seen as a linear optimization problem.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17387262709675.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>So, we need to determine zero-point and scale parameters. These parameters are often also publicly shared on platforms such as HuggingFace. The parameters can be chosen for the whole model or for each layer based on our performance tradeoff appetite. For many popular models like Llama, the quantization is done tensor-wise.</p> <p>The parameters can easily be determined as follows</p> \[\begin{align*} S &amp;= \frac{r_{max} - r_{min}}{q_{max} - q_{min}} \\ Z &amp;= \text{round}(q_{min} - \frac{r_{min}}{S}) \end{align*}\] <p>The bit-width \(n\) determines \(q_{min} = -2^{n -1}\) and \(q_{max} = 2^{n - 1} - 1\).</p> <p>Suppose we apply linear quantization to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matmul</code> -</p> \[\begin{align*} Y &amp;= WX \\ S_Y(q_Y - Z_Y) &amp;= S_W(q_W - Z_W)S_X(q_X - Z_X) \\ Q_Y = \frac{S_W S_X}{S_Y} \left( q_W q_X - Z_W q_X - \underset{Z_X q_W + Z_W Z_X) + Z_Y}{\text{precomputed for inference}} \right) \end{align*}\] <p>Empirically, the factor \(\frac{S_W S_X}{S_Y}\) is between 0 and 1. Instead of using floating point multiplications, it is represented as fixed point multiplication and bit shift. Also, empirically \(Z_W\) follows normal distribution and can be approximated as 0. Thus, the heavy lifting operation is \(q_Wq_X\) which is simply integer multiplication.</p> <p>Therefore, we reduced both storage and computation time (integer arithmetic is much faster and cheaper). This can also be used to reduce FP16 to FP8 rather than integers.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, we have <img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17387273312564.jpg" alt=""></p> <h1 id="large-language-models-on-cloud-and-edge">Large Language Models on Cloud and Edge</h1> <p>The first wave of revolution in ML systems was sparked by Big Data in 2010s (competitions like Netflix recommendation price), which resulted in systems such as XGBoost, Spark and GraphLab. Then in mid 2010s, deep-learning started gaining traction, and TensorFlow, TVM and Torch were created. Now, we’re in the third revolution with Generative AI. ML Systems is playing a much bigger role.</p> <p>The challenges involved are -</p> <ol> <li> <p>Memory - Llama-70B consumes 320GB VRAM just to store parameters in FP32</p> </li> <li> <p>Compute - The post-Moore era brings great demand for diverse specialized compute, system support becomes bottleneck</p> </li> </ol> <p>The design of systems depends on the paradigm that the industry is moving towards. Currently, we have cloud based models with a client-server architectures. This is how computers initially started before the age of personal computers. So, would we move towards personal AI in consumer devices?</p> <p>There are many engineering challenges involved in this. As we covered previously, there are specialized libraries and systems for each backend involving manually created optimizations. The area is very labor intensive with huge market-opportunities.</p> <p>Our approach to this has been in terms of composable optimizations to rewrite kernel codes. Furthermore, we added techniques such as parameter sharding, memory planning, operator fusion, etc to add to these optimizations. What have we learned from this journey?</p> <p>There are four abstractions we use</p> <ul> <li> <p>Computational Graphs - Graph and its extensions enable higher level program rewriting and optimization</p> </li> <li> <p>Tensor Programs - These abstractions focus on loop and layout transformation for fused operators</p> </li> <li> <p>Libraries and Runtimes - Optimizing libraries are built by vendors and engineers to accelerate key operators of interests</p> </li> <li> <p>Hardware Primitives - The hardware builders exposes novel primitives to provide native hardware acceleration</p> </li> </ul> <p>It has not been about a <strong>silver bullet system but continuous improvement and innovations</strong>. ML Engineering is going hand-in-hand with ML modeling.</p> <p>The developers of TVM are expanding it to TVMUnity to bring the compiler flow to the user. As we’ve studied, IRModule is the central abstraction in TVM. Once the user-level code is written in this form, TVM takes care of the hardware backend making it easy to the models on various architectures.</p> <p>TVM generates an optimized models, and features are continuously added with data to make it better over time.</p> <h2 id="tvm-unity">TVM Unity</h2> <h3 id="first-class-symbolic-shape-support">First-class symbolic shape support</h3> <p>Traditional models like ResNet have some key-characteristics. The compilers are being built under the assumption of these fixed parameters, but with the age of generative AI, these parameters keep changing continuously. TVMUnity leverages symbolic shift to incorporate variable sizes in the model. In essence, traditional compilers are unable to handle dynamic shapes, whereas TVMUnity allows it with symbolic support.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/2025-02-06-18-47-07-image.png" alt=""></p> <p>Knowing the dependencies between different variable parameters allows for better optimizations during runtime - static memory planning for dynamic shapes</p> <h3 id="composable-tensor-optimization">Composable Tensor Optimization</h3> <p>In the early ages, we had scalar computing. Then came the age of vector computing with SIMD. Now, NVIDIA has TensorCore and TPUs became a thing for tensor computing. How do we leverage these hardware developments in our programs? We want both loop based optimization and tensor-based programs.</p> <p>The first step is to isolate the internal computation tensorized computation from external loops to create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Block</code>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/2025-02-06-18-52-50-image.png" alt=""></p> <p>With this, TVMUnity does <em>Imperative Schedule Transformation</em> to search different variants of programs by changing blocks to create an optimized IR.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/2025-02-06-18-53-13-image.png" alt=""></p> <p>By providing this interface to the user, where the user can mention the parameters involved, TVMUnity can perform tensorization along with graph-optimization problem.</p> <h3 id="bringing-compilation-and-libraries-together">Bringing compilation and Libraries Together</h3> <p>We have seen this tradeoff with compilers and libraries.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/2025-02-06-18-57-28-image.png" alt=""></p> <p>TVMUnity provides interfaces like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Relax-BYOC</code> to offload the computational load to libraries such as TensoIR to leverage the library-optimized kernels. The native compilation works on top of the library offloading to increase the performance even more.</p> <p>By adding this flexibility, the compiler can update (live with library updates) to squeeze the best performance.</p> <p>Since libraries come out with data layout requirements, the compiler can use this information to optimize the remaining parts of the code.</p> <h2 id="ml-compilation-in-action">ML Compilation in Action</h2> <p>How does this architecture help with incremental developments? The users can try new optimizations in coordination with the compiler to scale to newer models.</p> <p>In language models, the compiler does targeted optimizations such a low-bit quantizations, dynamic shape planning, fusion and hardware aware optimizations, etc. Along with these, it works with KVCache etc to improve the performance.</p> <p>The <strong>MLCEngine</strong> is a universal LLM deployment engine being developed to deploy LLMs on any device. The key contribution here is <em>universal</em>. This development also revealed some key insights - iOS devices require custom Metal language kernels, Snapdragon devices require OpenCL - and this project is trying to take care of all of that.</p> <p>It also helps with structured generation with near zero overhead. This feature would be super useful for agent use cases. <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mlc-ai/WebLLM-Structured-Generation-Playground" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Surprisingly, MLCEngine does it with near zero overhead with something known as XGrammar!</a></p> <p>They also created <a href="https://webllm.mlc.ai/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">WebLLM</a> with the new WebGPU standard to use the local compute to the browser. Yes, it uses your local GPUs and doesn’t send your data to any server! You can use this to build stuff on top of it with the typescript API and a Node package. It is an open source project too!</p> <p>Let us continue our discussion on Quantization. We discussed about quantization granularity (per-tensor, per-channel, group quantizations).</p> <p>Per-channel quantization is preferred to tensor quantization in some cases because the channels can have very different ranges, and using a single \(S\) can result in lopsided representations. Even then, some applications can lose too much on performance for per-channel quantization. In these cases, group quantization is useful.</p> <p>Group quantization is more fine-grained. E.g., per vector. It has more accuracy, less quantization error trading off some of the savings.</p> <blockquote> <p>Can we do some sort of statistical grouping here?</p> </blockquote> <p>The sweet-spot that works in practice is a two-level quantization that quantizes hierarchically. Instead of using \(r = S(q - Z)\) we use \(r = \gamma S_q (q = Z)\). \(\gamma\) is a gloating-point coarse grained scale factor, and \(S_Q\) is an integer per-vector scale factor. It can be further generalized into multi-level quantization with scale factors for each levels.</p> <p>So far, we have done quantization of weights. They are static during inference, and so everything works. What if we want to quantize the activations? The stats change with every input. This problem is solved in two ways:</p> <ol> <li>Moving average - Observed ranges are smoothed across thousands of training steps</li> <li>Calibration dataset - Figure out the range from subset of training set</li> </ol> <h2 id="mixed-precision">Mixed Precision</h2> <p>In the previous methods, we have done <em>uniform quantization</em> wherein every weight parameter is quantized to the same number of bits. However, what if we use different precision for different weights? Does this improve the performance a lot? The implementation is however very complicated since we have to deal with different data formats. Also, what formats give the best savings and high performance?</p> <p>These are hard questions. So we throw ML at the problem. We define a cost function to let a model discover the combination of formats that give the best parameters. It was a good research field, and the accuracy of models improved by 10% or so.</p> <p>After a while, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03740" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA released a paper</a> (it’s a good read) that became the standard for mixed precision training. The intuition for this approach is as follows. Some layers are more sensitive to dynamic range and precision. For example, softmax and normalization layers have a large range of values. We identify such operations and assign them higher precision.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17393289702270.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Since Adam calculates two moments and normalizes the gradients, we use FP32 for the weight updates.</p> <p><em>Note.</em> Deepseek changed the standard with new precisions.</p> <p>Let us see how the memory of models changes with this new precision system. Again, for the largest GPT, there are 175B parameters. So it occupies 350G with FP16 for all the weights. The activations occupy 7488G assuming checkpointing at each layer boundary.</p> <p>So in this system, the master model with FP32 weights occupies 4<em>175 = 700G. The gradients occupy 2</em>175 = 350G. The running copy of the model used for inference is 2<em>175 = 350G. Finally, we need Adam mean and variance (FP32) that is 2</em>4*175 = 1400G. The rule of thumb in general is \((4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4)N = 16N\) memory for LLMs.</p> <h3 id="scaling-down-ml">Scaling down ML</h3> <p>Running ML on edge devices is always strongly demanded, and the market is very fragmented. It is easy to build a startup and get acquired in this space. The possible research directions are quantization, pruning, ML energy efficiency, federated ML, etc.</p> <h1 id="parallelization-1">Parallelization</h1> <p>Moore’s law came to an end. However, ML models were scaling 3x every 18 months! Why? Bigger model gives better accuracy. People have also started seeing emergent capabilities in larger models.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17393299103392.gif" alt=""></p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17393300313845.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>So, the models are going to get bigger. Along with this, the memory demand is increasing too. It was back in 2019 when we last fit an entire model in one GPU. Now we require 100s of GPUs just to store the model parameters. The only way out of this is parallelization. Wait! Aren’t GPUs already doing that?</p> <blockquote> <p>GPUs did data parallelization. We are talking about having multiple GPUs and using them together. All the things we considered so far assumed the entire model is on one GPU. Now, we need to distribute the model training. We just seem to be creating problems for ourselves…</p> </blockquote> <p>Intuitively there are multiple ways we can go about this</p> <ol> <li>Parallelize along the layers (cutting through depth)</li> <li>Parallelize each layer (cutting through breadth) - this one is rather complicated with more data traveling between clusters.</li> </ol> <p>Apart from these considerations, a GPU cluster also has its own constraints. There are different latency communication channels (kind of like memory hierarchy).</p> <p>Let us look at the problem from a computational lens. A model involves parameters, weight updates, model spec and the data.</p> <ul> <li>Computing - The forward pass and backward pass require compute</li> <li>Memory - The data and parameters require memory. Between these, we require communication (typically done with interconnects or network, e.g., NVLink) which is the main bottleneck in this whole setup. How do we communicate parameters and activations?</li> </ul> <p>In <strong>data parallelism</strong>, we partition the data across GPUs and give each GPU a copy of the parameters and gradients. Then, we need to synchronize the updates together across the GPUs before the next iteration.</p> <p>In <strong>model parallelism</strong>, we partition the model across GPUs and use the data to update parts of the model. This method is more complicated. Let us delve deeper.</p> <p>How do we partition a computation graph on a device cluster?</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17393313839159.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>There are more strategies that consider hybrid variants - some parts of the model are inter-op, intra-op and some parameters are replicated across devices.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17393315930822.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>These are the standard techniques being used for the models today.</p> <p>Let us delve deeper into these. <img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17393318019536.jpg" alt=""> In the above example, intra-op is similar to what we discussed before for matmul on GPUs - each GPU computes a partial sum. Surprisingly, we can show mathematically that this is the best we can do with inter-op.</p> <p>What are the pros and cons?</p> <ul> <li>Inter-op parallelism requires point-to-point communication but results in devices being idle.</li> <li>Intra-op parallelism keeps the devices busy but requires collective communication.</li> </ul> <p>The all-reduce operation is computationally intensive.</p> <p>Since intra-op requires more communication, this is an important aspect to consider. On the other hand, inter-op results in hardware bubble wherein some of the GPUs are idle (can be prevented to some extent with pipelining).</p> <p>In summary, inter-op parallelism requires point to point communication but results in idle devices. The devices are busy in intra-op parallelism but requires collective communication.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>A note on terminology</strong> Previously, the literature used to talk about data and model parallelism. Data parallelism is general and precise but the term “model parallelism” is vague. That is why, we stick to the terms inter-op and intra-op parallelism which rely on the pillars of computational graph and device cluster. Furthermore, we are mainly discussing about model parallelism because of the regime in which models do not fit on a single GPU anymore.</p> </blockquote> <p>With that, let us formulate our goal - “What is the most efficient way to execute a graph using combinations of inter-op and intra-op parallelism subject to memory and communication constraints?”</p> <p>Let us equip ourselves with a metric to quantify this goal. Previously we had, Arithmetic Intensity. Now, we consider <strong>Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU)</strong></p> \[MFU = \#FLOPs/t/\text{peak FLOPs}\] <p>Where #FLOPs is the total FLOPs in the ML program, and \(t\) is the time required to finish the program. The goal is to maximize this quantity.</p> <p>Why don’t we achieve the peak FLOPs? The Peak FLOPs values are typically achieved by matrix multiplications but a neural network model like a transformer involves many layer operations (memory bounded) that lower the performance. Moreover, we have seen how optimization can greatly reduce the time of execution and increase the operations within the same time. Unoptimized code can lower the value further. Adding to these communication like we have discussed before can reduce the quantity a lot too. Finally, all these parameters also depend on the precision, code and the GPU type being used.</p> <p>How do we calculate the MFU?</p> <ol> <li>Count the number of operations (FLOPs) considering the shape of the data in the model. For example, we have seen the formula \(2mnp\) for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matmul</code>.</li> <li>Run the model for one forward and backward pass on the GPU to get benchmark for the running time \(t\)</li> <li>Check the GPU spec, type of cores, and their peak FLOPs</li> <li>Calculate the MFU</li> </ol> <p>What is the history of these numbers?</p> <ol> <li>The best ML system on V100 a couple years ago got 40-50% MFU - only half the peak utilization! The peak FLOPs on V100 is 112 TFLOPs, so we were only able to use 50-60 FLOPs</li> <li>With A100, we were still in the same range until FlashAttention came up, which took the MFU value to 60%! A100 has 312 FLOPs, so we are using ~160FLOPs at this stage!</li> <li>With H100, we are able to use only 30-50% depending on the model size (Larger <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matmul</code> is better for MFU over smaller). Why did it decrease? The peak value of H100 is very high (990 TFLOPs), and our software did not catch up to this. Remember that communication also plays an important role</li> <li>This year, with B100 the peak FLOPs is 1.8 PFLOPs!</li> </ol> <p>Besides MFU, we also define <strong>Hardware FLOPs Utilization (HFU)</strong>. This quantity is to consider operations that do not contribute to the model For example, we can treat gradient checkpointing as 2 forward passes and 1 backward pass (each backward pass can be approximated as 2 forward passes due to gradient updates)</p> <h2 id="collective-communication">Collective Communication</h2> <p>In Machine Learning systems, there are usually two types of connections</p> <ol> <li>Point-to-point communication - Comprises of a sender and a receiver. Very simple.</li> <li>Collective Communication - It’s a common concept in HPC (high performance computing). There are multiple forms of this <ol> <li>Broadcast - One worker shares data with all the other workers</li> <li>Reduce(-to-one) - All the data among the workers is combined into one rank (one worker). Essentially reverse of broadcast in a way.</li> <li>Scatter - The data from one rank is split and each of the splits is <em>scattered</em> across other ranks. That is, every worker gets on part of the data.</li> <li>Gather - The reverse operation of Scatter, where different parts of the data are <em>gathered</em> into one rank.</li> <li>All-gather - Essentially gather followed by broadcast.</li> <li>Reduce-scatter - Essentially reduce followed by scatter.</li> <li>All-reduce - Reduce followed by scatter.</li> </ol> <p>Collective communication is more expensive than P2P since it can be thought of as a combination of many P2Ps. However, collective communication has been highly optimized in the past 2 decades (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(x)ccl</code> libraries - NVIDIA has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NCCL</code> the best, Microsoft has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MCCL</code> and Intel has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OneCCL</code>). The important thing to note is that collective communication is not fault tolerant (if one device fails, then everything fails).</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id="basics">Basics</h3> <p>Let us understand some more terminology for communication models. There is a terminology called as \(\alpha\beta\) model that talks about latency and bandwidth. For example, if the model is \(\alpha + n \beta\) then \(\alpha\) refers to the latency and \(\beta = 1/B\) is the reciprocal of bandwidth determined by the hardware. For smaller messages, latency (\(\alpha\)) is the dominant factor, and for larger messages (larger \(n\)), the bandwidth utilization (\(n\beta\)) dominates.</p> <p>Based on these distinctions, the community works on two mainstream algorithms/implementations</p> <ol> <li>For smaller messages, an MST based algorithm that emphasizes low latency</li> <li>For larger messages, a <strong>Ring algorithm</strong> to emphasize on bandwidth utilization.</li> </ol> <p>There are over 50+ algorithms in this area and the HPC community even got the 2023 Turing award!</p> <p>The core principle for lower latency is to minimize the number of rounds needed for communication. For example, consider the Broadcast operation.</p> <ol> <li>We first split the ranks into half, and send the message to the half without the message</li> <li>Then repeat broadcast recursively in each half</li> </ol> <p><em>Beautiful.</em></p> <p>For the core operations, we have the following communication models</p> <ul> <li>Reduce-to-one - \(\log(p) (\alpha + n \beta + n \gamma)\)</li> <li>Scatter and Gather- \(\log(p)\alpha + \frac{p - 1}{p} n\beta\)</li> <li>Broadcast - \(\log(p)(\alpha + n \beta)\)</li> </ul> <p>The remaining composite operations can simply use these primitives.</p> <p>What are the problems with this approach? Since latency is prioritized over bandwidth, some links are idle. Building on the same idea, the core principle for high-bandwidth is to use all links between every two nodes.</p> <p>The <strong>ring algorithm</strong> essentially is a logical ring that can be embedded in a physical linear array with worm-hole routing such that the “wrap-around” message does not conflict. Look at the diagram below for clarity -</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17395038648341.jpg" alt=""> At every instant, all the links are used ensuring full-bandwidth. For example, reduce-scatter can be implemented as consecutive reduce and propagate ring passes.</p> <p>For this regime of communication, the core primitives of communication are</p> <ul> <li>Reduce-scatter</li> <li>Scatter</li> <li>Gather</li> <li>All-gather and the other operations can be implemented as the composites of these</li> <li>Reduce(-to-one) is reduce-scatter followed by gather</li> <li>All-reduce is reduce-scatter followed by all-gather</li> <li>Broadcast is scatter followed by all-gather.</li> </ul> <p>So, how does this all come back to ML? ML systems are usually composed of large data communications. Inter-op systems always result in P2P communications and intra-op result in collective communication.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2025-01-06-data-systems-for-ml/17395041727515.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>The key point to note is that communication always happens between nodes that are partitioned differently. Remember that with tensors there are more dimensions, and the above diagram is a simplified version.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/brains-and-ai/">Brains and AI</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/machine-learning-systems/">Machine Learning Systems</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/ai-agents/">AI Agents</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/rl-theory/">Reinforcement Learning Theory</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/Statistical-NLP/">Statistical Natural Language Processing</a> </li> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Sudhansh Peddabomma.
