# Thales:

- founder of Ionian school
- critical reasoning bursting into area dominated by religion and mythical wisdom
- principle of movement (changes in nature) fundamental to order
- question existing systems of knowledge, get to know possible misunderstandings. learn about things as they are, not as they appear (don't be deceived by appearances). do things happen independent of our observation of them? (cause and effect)
- everything is water. no shape, no form, but is needed for vitality and growth.
- tried to communicate in a way understandable to common folk, which misses the point.
- insights about nature, geometry, astronomy, meteorology

# Pythagoras

- combine mysticism (expressed through music) and math
- he thought numbers can explain harmony. they represent everything in nature. demonstrative deductive knowledge, which is needed for truth!
- seek measure, order, patterns, propositions.
- mathematical thinking can purify thoughts. introduced the axiomatic method (in deductive mathematical argument, conclusion is intuititively obvious).

# Socrates

- tried to bring order to the intellectuals by serving as a moderator between conservatives and liberals.
- don't blindly accept opinions, they might be misleading. Think!
- socratic method had
		|- lower skepticism: the goal is to arrive at the truth
		|- dialogue: question popular beliefs and get to know origins
		|- concepts/definitions: getting correct definitions is the goal of knowledge
		|- inductive arguments: refer to particular instances
		|- deductive arguments: test consequences of evidence to test validity
- tried to illicit truth through conversation
- knowledge is the highest good. right thinking is needed to perform a right action. everyone must understand morality.
- virtue is identical to true happiness. knowledge is necessary and sufficient for virtue (improvement of soul). happy man is he who is brave, wise, temperate, just. pleasure (body) is not happiness (soul)!
- teacher can transmit knowledge, but virtue can only be attained by practice and self-contemplation. role of the wise is to cure social ills.
- Athenians weren't willing to criticise/evaluate themselves. open society is only formed through establishment of critical tradition.

# Plato

- follower of Socrates
- genuine knowledge is eternal and absolute (inspired by Parmenides). experiences are not true knowledge. real can be comprehended through reason. don't judge based on appearances.
- conceptual thinking, knowledge, precision.
- generalization (Ideas) and particularization (objects). thinking and synthesis of _concepts_, not images or sensuous things.
- particulars are copies of universals.
- according to Parmenides, ideas are not thoughts; there is only one idea which is not known to us because knowledge is not absolute. according to Plato, ideas are things that partake of particulars. there are multiple indivisible ideas that can be grasped using reason, and he compared these ideas to the soul. epistemology was about classifying these ideas. non-temporal and in independent realm.
- integrated metaph and epistem. soul is akin to form, so can grasp ideas. goodness is the highest idea, known as Logos (principle of divine reason and cosmic order). opinion possible through observation, knowledge only through contemplation.
- stuff changes (like Protagoras and Heraclitus), sensuous experiences are subject to changes so senses bad.
- soul is immortal and exists without body. soul is like the charioteer of the body which is the chariot.
- tripartite relation between reason (rational part - acts through rational faculty like intellectual activities), spirit (irrational part - acts through spirited faculty like will and faculty of decision), and appetite (acts through appetitive faculty like desire for food/wealth).
- two types of pleasure - senses and reason. psychological relativity is neutral point between pleasure and pain.
- desire hinders reason. ultimate goal should be happiness, not pleasure (and desire promotes pleasure).
- should understand epistemic content of actions!
- a just man is a happy man. a life of virtue/reason is the highest good. 
- soul should realize wisdom, courage, temperance, justice. the more reasonable a desire, the more pleasurable its gratification. pursue intellectual desires and not sensuous ones!
- perfection lies in the contemplation of truth.

# Aristotle

- form and matter (forms are inherent in any thing, not transcendent but immanent, matter combines with form to constitute individual things and moves/changes/grows/evolves according to the whims of its form | not a shadow of the real world, _is_ the real world)
- universe is ideal, a system of eternal forms. experience is the basis of knowledge. genuine knowledge is in knowing reasons for things -- it includes math and all sciences. aristotle divided these into branches:
	- Logic
	- Theoretical Sciences (Math, Phy, Bio, Psych, Metaphysics)
	- Practical Sciences (Ethics, Politics)
	- Productive Sciences (Esthetics)
- logic is necessary because to show scientific propositions, we need to show _necessity_. Not only is this the case, but it cannot conceivable be otherwise.
inferences -> judgements|-> propositions (when expressed in language)
						|-> concepts -> terms
- deduction is of the form of syllogism.
- reason is the highest part of the soul
- basic truths are potential in mind, experience is required to make reason aware of them - reaffirms Plato's reminiscence thing
- aristotle's categories
		|-substance (what it is)
		|-quality (how it is constituted)
		|-quantity (how large it is)
		|-relation (how related)
		|-space (where)
		|-time (when)
		|-position (what posture)
		|-state (the condition it is in)
		|-activity (what it does)
		|-passivity (what it suffers)
- science deals with the category of being/substance, so transition from logic to metaphysics
- meta studies being qua being. for Plato, substance is the universal (exists in another world), but for Aristotle, substance is the individual.
- page 104 (124) has arguments of Aristotle against Plato
- there is a plurality of individual substances (pluralism as opposed to monism). substances arrange themselves on ascending scale with indeterminate matter at bottom and God at top.
- universal and particular are _merged_ to form the complete unity of the individual.
- object changes form means that a new form fashions the matter, not that the form itself changes. these forms have always existed. neither matter/forms appear/disappear, they are the eternal principles.
- potentiality is that which lies latent within the thing, actuality is the actual completed thing. progressive realization of prepondance of form over matter.
- development is governed by four causes
		|- material cause (from which the thing is made - the bronze from which the statue is made)
		|- formal cause (that which the thing essentially is - the plan/idea of the statue as conceived by the sculptor)
		|- efficient/moving cause (that through which the thing is produced - english meaning of cause, the chisels and stuff used to make the statue)
		|- final cause (that for the sake of which the thing is made - the final realized statue)
- matter offers resistance to the form, which is the reason things are imperfect.
- since any object must be moved by another, there must exist an unmoved mover. this is God. first cosmological formulation for existence of God. God is the _final cause_, highest purpose/good in the world. God is form without matter and is the one exception to the rule that matter, form are inseparable. full actuality, no potentiality. God is thought-thinking-thought. man's reason is divine. the only worthy object of God's thought is God, so God is thought-thinking-thought.
- Reality, as conceived by Aristotle, is a plurality of individual substances, each of which is a fusion of form and matter; these substances are ordered in a continuous series according to the predominance of form over matter; the supreme substance is pure form or God.
- everything has some end purpose. highest good is the complete exercise of the functions that make one a human being. this is _eudaemonia_, which translates to happiness. happiness leads to pleasure (not other way round).
- virtuous soul is one in which there is balance between reason, feeling, and desire.
- perfect action of reason is intellectual/dianoetic virtue. perfect action of emotional-impulsive functions is moral virtue. moral virtue is the mean thing. relative to ourselves. decided by the right-minded man or by reason. not isolated actions, but disposition of will. so, highest good is self-realization (this is not selfish individualism).
- highest happiness is speculative activity. in addition to a knowledge of virtue, we should possess and exercise it.
