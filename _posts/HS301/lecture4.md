## Skepticism

*Pyrrho* started this idea that truth is never known, and having complete knowledge is impossible. Everything that is seen may not always be true.

> Skepticism - Uncertainty of Human Knowledge

Doubting is a form of learning. For example, Rene Descartes, used a mathematical form of skepticism (Probability?).

## Sources of Knowledge in India Philosophy

- *Prathyakhsha* - Perception
- *Anumana* - Inference
- *Upamana* - Comparison
- *Sabdda* - Testimony

These are the means through which knowledge is gained via experience.

## Foundation of Knowledge

The rationalists believed **reason** is the primary source of knowledge, whereas empiricists believed **experience** is the primary source of knowledge. We shall learn about both these schools of knowledge in due time.

## Logic

This is another branch of Philosophy like epistemology. Logic is known as *Tarka shastra* in Indian philosophy.  Laws of thought like the law of identity, the law of contradiction, etc., were developed using a human's thinking structure.

>  Tarka - Arguments

It involves deductive and inductive arguments. Aristotle introduced **deductive** arguments. These arguments are in the premise-predicate form. The premises are based on universal truths. Francis Bacon presented **inductive** arguments. He spoke about $$5$$ different types of induction. 

- Method of Agreement
- Method of Difference
- Joint Method of agreement in presence of difference
- Method of Concomitant variation
- Method of Residues

In this realm, assumptions are based on experience.

Therefore, along with epistemological inquiry, one must check for the arguments associated with the theory. Logic is an integral part of Philosophy.

## Ethics / Aesthetics

Philosophy also deals with the study of values and beauty. This is also a branch of Philosophy along with Metaphysics, Epistemology, and Logic.
