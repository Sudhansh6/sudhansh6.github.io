A deterministic automaton has a single choice of transition from a given state for a given symbol from the alphabet. However, in the case of a non-deterministic automata, such guarantee does not exist. The next state for a given symbol from a given state of the NFA is a set of states rather than a single state. There are two types of NFA as discussed previously.

- Don't know NFA - Guess the right choice
- Don't care NFA - All choices give the same result

One might ponder if NFAs are more expressive than DFAs. The answer is surprisingly no. Non-determinism can be introduced to an automaton in two ways -

- Choice of subset of states for each transition
- $$\epsilon$$-transitions

**Example.** Construct an automaton to represent the language $$L = \{abc\} \cup \{\text{all strings ending in b}\}$$ whose alphabet is $$\{a,b,c\}$$

**Note.** We have introduced $$\epsilon$$-transitions in this automaton.

As we shall see later in the course, the three models - DFA, NFA, and NFA with $$\epsilon$$-transitions; are all equivalent in terms of expressive power.

## Properties of Languages

We mainly check two properties of languages - decision and closure.

- Decision - Is $$w \in L$$? (Membership Problem) - decidable for regular languages.

  Decidable problems - Problems for which we can write a **sound** algorithm which **halts in finite time**.

  We can also consider problems like - Given $$DFA(M_1)$$ and $$DFA(M_2)$$, Is $$L(M_1) = L(M_2)$$? or $$L(M_1) \subset L(M_2)$$?

  Is $$L = \phi$$? Is $$L$$ finite? Is $$L$$ finite and has an even number of strings? We can also ask questions about the DFA - Can $$L(M)$$ be accepted by a DFA with $$k < n$$ states (minimalism)?

  ***Example.*** Can we build a DFA whose language is $$L = \{\text{bit strings divisible by } 7\}$$ with less than 7 states? Turns out, the answer is no.

  Finally, we can ask a very difficult question such as - Show $$L$$ cannot be accepted by any DFA. The technique for solving such a question is known as the ***Pumping Lemma***. This lemma is based on the *Pigeonhole principle*.

- Closure - closure using Union, Intersection, Kleene Star, and Concatenation. The question we ask is if $$L_1, L_2$$ belong to class $$C$$, then does $$L_1 \texttt { op } L_2$$ belong to $$C$$?
