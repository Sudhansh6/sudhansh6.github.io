The lexical analyzer 

- detects the next lexeme
- categorizes it into the right token
- passes to the syntax analyzer

Creating a lexical analyzer

- Hand code
- Use a generator - Generates from formal description. Less prone to errors.

A formal description of the tokens of the source language will consist of

- A regular expression describing each token, and
- A code fragment called an **action routine** describing the action to be performed, on identifying each token.

The generator puts together 

- A DFA constructed from the token specification
- A code fragment called a driver routine which can traverse any DFA
- Action routines
