## Linear Programming and primal-dual methods

For any linear problem,

$$ \min c^Tx \\ \text{ s.t. } Ax \geq b \\ \hspace{2em} x \geq 0$$

Its dual is given by 

$$ \min y^Tb \\ \text{ s.t. } y^TA \leq c^T \\ \hspace{2em} y \geq 0$$

[Here](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/advanced-algorithms-and-complexity/duality-N5N2W) is a course on Linear programming.

For example, consider the problem of reconstructing an image from compressed measurements. The primary function is given by,
$$
\min \|x\|_1 \\
\text{s.t.} \|Ax - y \|_2 \leq \epsilon
$$
I jumped the gun too soon. I have no idea what the dual is.

## Primal Dual Method

Max-flow and min-cut are LP dual problems.

We typically devise algorithms (for minimization problems) using the PD-schema in the following way:

1. Write down an LP relaxation of the problem, and find its dual. Try to find some intuitive meaning for the dual variables.
2. Start with vectors $$x = 0, y = 0$$, which will be dual feasible, but primal infeasible
3. Until the primal is feasible,
   1. Increase the dual values $$y_i$$ in some controlled fashion until some dual constraint(s) goes tight, while always maintaining the dual feasibility of $$y$$.
   2. Select some subset of the tight dual constraints, and increase the primal variable corresponding to them by an integral amount.
4. For the analysis, prove that the output pair of vectors $$(x, y)$$ satisfies $$c^T x\leq \rho \cdot y^Tb$$ for as small a value of $$\rho$$ as possible.
