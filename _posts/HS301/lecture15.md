> qua being - A state of higher existence

Aristotle continued...

Plato thought 'form' and 'matter' existed at different levels. However, Aristotle says form and matter are inseparable.

## Potentiality and Actuality: Explanation of Change

Clay is the primordial stuff. A pot *potentially* exists in clay. How can a pot be *actualized*? - Efficient Cause

The Form of Pot - The structure given to the object pot - Formal Cause.

The final use of Pot - Final Cause.

Every object that is created has a purpose of serving - a teleological view of reality. Present science represents things in more objectively and does not use the teleological view. 

## Logic

Aristotle was dedicated to segregate Logic from the remaining branches. Logic is the method of reasoning for the acquisition of genuine knowledge. 

> Truth - Something which cannot be other than it is - Necessity
>
> Contingent Statements - Not necessarily true

Demonstration in the form of Deduction - **Syllogism**. It's about a form of an argument consisting of Premised and Conclusions. 

### Logic as a form of thinking

Form constitutes the essence of things. Human reasoning has the power of discerning the form. Thought and being/ existence coincide according to Aristotle. "Rational knowledge is implicit in the mind but experience is necessary to make reason aware of them." - Thilly.

## Syllogism

It's a form of reasoning to which all deduction is reducible. 

- Terms 
- Propositions. There are 4 types of propositions as classified by Aristotle
  - A - Universal Affirmative $$\forall$$
  - E - Universal Negative $$\neg \forall$$
  - I - Particular Affirmative $$\exists$$
  - O - Particular Negative $$\neg \exists$$
-  Moods - The types of propositions used in the arguments/proof.
-  Figures 
- Rules
  - The fallacy of undistributed middle - The middle term must be distributed at least once in any of the premises.
  - Illicit major/minor - If a term is distributed in the conclusion then it must be distributed in the premises.
  - The fallacy of two exclusive premises - From two negative premises no conclusion follows.
  - At least one of the premises must be universal.
  - If there is any particular premise, then the conclusion must be particular.  
  - If one the premises is negative, then the conclusion will be negative.
