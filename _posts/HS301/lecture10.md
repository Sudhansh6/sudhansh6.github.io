Socrates believed virtue has to be practiced.

> Virtue - behavior showing high moral standards.   

 In those days, Athenians depended upon the Sophists' guidance. However, Socrates believed every human had the power to acquire knowledge for himself. 

Socrates urged for clear and rational thinking. He believed knowledge and virtue were necessary for a just society. Actions may be rational, but they need not be ethical. One needs to have moral courage.

## What is knowledge?

Socrates believed every individual must understand the meaning of mortality - *Moral knowledge*. It was necessary for resolving social conflicts and establishing a **just society**.

Knowledge is necessary and sufficient for virtue. Can virtue be taught? Socrates thought it could not be taught. One can become virtuous by practicing virtue. Every individual must reflect on oneself and examine whatever they are engaged in.

## Agony of Athenians

Athenians were not ready to accept and evaluate themselves. "Arrogance". Socrates was raising some fundamental questions about the so-called wise Sophists. He was questioning their practice, and people were not ready to accept this.
