## Aristotle's Psychology & Ethics

We again talk about the tripartite relation of soul. Layers of soul - Rational, Sensible, and Nutritional. Body and soul are related as matter and form. Soul is the form of the body, it makes the body as organic whole having purposes as a unit. Soul moves the body and perceives sensible objects. It is characterized by **sensation**, **feeling**, and **motive**. It controls the lower and vital function.

The nature Reason - Potentially powerful to carry out functions of thinking. Conceptual thought is actualised reason. Active reason can be identified with universal reason or the mind of the God. It does not arise in the course of soul's development as do the other psychic functions. Active reason is the divine mind coming to the soul from without.

*Creative* Reason is the pure actuality; its concepts are actualised by it, the essences are directly cognized. Creative reason is absolutely immortal, imperishable, and not bound to the body. 

Aristotle thought desire gave birth to ideas. The layers of soul is not top-down but bottom-up! Reason is placed at the highest level. Aristotle did not identify mind with soul!!!! 

> mind - soul | Rationalism - Actual Reason

## Ethics - Eudaimonia (Highest Good)

Aristotle's metaphysics and psychology form the basis of his theory of ethics which is the first comprehensive scientific theory of morality. Aristotle possible aimed answering the Socratic question of Highest Good. Ethics, a study of morality, talks about means and ends. Gather good karma to achieve the highest good.

Is pleasure good? Aristotle says pleasure and good are different.

## Virtue

Intellectual and Moral Virtue. Every individual is not born as a rational person. As a person transpires in the society, he acquires rational thoughts. Having reason is not enough to talk about morality. You can be a rational person, but need not be moral! Therefore, Aristotle talks about 2 different types of virtue.

- Intellectual Virtue - Virtue of Wisdom, quest for knowledge, perfection in thinking conceptually and coherently - and insight
- Phronesis - Practical virtue
- Moral virtue - Perfect action of emotional - Impulsive function consists of assuring rational attitude. Temperance, courage, liberality.

Virtue is a kind of moderation in that it aims at the mean - the mean between excess and deficiencies. Courage is a mean between foolhardiness and cowardice. Liberality is a mean between extravagance and avarice. Modesty is a mean between bashfulness and shamelessness.  Wow that was tough.

Moral judgement is not a subjective opinion o arbitrary choice. Moral conduct must be decided by the right kind of man. Virtuous men are the standard and measure of things. They exhibit moral character and stable conduct.

>  Virtue is a disposition. A person is not born with virtuousness, but acquires it.

## Justice

Justice is a virtue implying a relation to others, for it promotes the interest of another.
