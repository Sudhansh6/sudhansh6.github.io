## How to make simulations?
As weâ€™ve seen, simulations can range from games to real-world replications with physics involved. Most simulations are not designed keeping AI in mind. However, with the current state of AI, this is an important factor to keep in mind.

Classical environments like in Zork/AI2 Thor/Mujoco have something known as **PDDLs**. Some simulations are built through AI, like *AI Dungeon* that spins up worlds for role-play games.

### Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)
Standard encoding for classic planning tasks. Many specific languages for creating simulations have similarities with PDDL. 

A PDDL Task consists of the following
- Objects - things in the world that interest us
- Predicates - Properties of objects that we are interested in, can be true or false
- Initial state - The state of the world that we start in
- Goal specification - Things that we want to be true
- Actions/Operators - Ways of changing the state of the world.

These are split across two files - domain and problem `.pddl` files.

Classic symbolic planners read PDDLs and give possible solutions. Checkout the [Planning.wiki](https://planning.wiki/ref/planners/atoz). In many cases these planners are used over reinforcement learning due to lack of algorithmic guarantees.
