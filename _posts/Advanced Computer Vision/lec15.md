## Lighting

Unlike material properties and geometry, lighting is an external factor that is very complicated to infer. Lighting in a scene can. Be categorised as 

- Local illumination - Li
- Global illumination

## Shape

Normals
Explicit representations
Implicit representations - SDF

# Inverse Rendering

## PhySG

Geometry - SDF, Lighting - Environment map, Material (BRDF)
Sphere Tracing!
Monte Carlo integration for BRDFs - too slow. PhySG - spherical Gaussians
