# Brownian Motion (Wiener Process)

Brownian motion is defined as a stochastic process defined on continuous time - $W = (W_t, t \geq 0)$. It is defined on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$ and has the following properties -

- $W_0 = 0$

- **Independent increments** - Given a set of times $t_0, \dots, t_n$ such that $0 = t_0 <t_1 < \cdots < t_n$ then $W_{t_1} - W_{t_0}, \dots, W_{t_{n}} - W_{t_{n - 1}}$ are independent.

- **Gaussian increments** - For $0 \leq s \leq t$, $W_t - W_s \sim \mathcal N(0, t - s)$.

- For a fixed $\omega \in \Omega$, the function $t \to W_t(\omega)$ is continuous.

Equivalently, a Brownian motion is a stochastic process $(w_t: t \geq 0)$ is a Gaussian process with $\mathbb E(W_t) = 0, cov(W_s, W_t) = s \wedge t$ for all $s, t$ and $t \to W_t$ is continuous.

This is equivalent to the third property, for $s < t$, 

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb E[W_sW_t] &= \mathbb E[W_s(W_s + (W_t - W_s)]  \\
&= \mathbb E[W_s^2] + \mathbb E[W_s(W_t - W_s)] \\
\end{align*}
$$

since $W_s - W_0$ is a Gaussian distribution and independent increments property,

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb E[W_sW_t] &= \mathbb E[W_s^2] + \mathbb E[W_s(W_t - W_s)] \\
&= s^2 + \mathbb E[W_s]\mathbb E[W_t - W_s] = s^2
\end{align*}
$$
