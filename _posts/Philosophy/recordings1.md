## Introduction to Philosophy

What is Philosophy? It is a humanistic discipline that investigates the nature of values and relationships that integrate humanity with or reality as a whole. It is the love of knowledge about the heart of reality, mind, values, etc. A philosopher needs to understand the very development of such a knowledge system.

### The source of origin of philosophy

All knowledge systems are developed from human/thinking thoughts. Speculating about the very nature of existence is the basis of **philosophical thinking**. 

## Philosophical Thinking

A philosophical investigation is conceptual. Philosophers think through concepts, and their effort is to make sense of experiences and ideas concerning the subject matter. Philosophical thinking is speculative, Imaginative/creative, Reflective/Critical, Argumentative, and liberal/inclusive.

**Speculative thinking** - Knowledge is merely based on experience and **intuitive insights** beyond the expertise of observable facts. It highlights the power of imagination in forming or visualizing something - the existence of the underlying principle. For example, Pythagoras used numbers to speculate about reality. Thales theorized that five fundamental elements constitute reality.
Imagination is the spirit of discovery/invention. 

Imagination is the spirit of discovery/invention. 

**Creative Thinking** - Rabindranath Tagore was a poet, philosopher and his poems are among the finest expressions of creativity that aspired to grasp the truth.

**Reflective/critical thinking** - Many philosophers and philosophical traditions accept critical thinking as a method of doing philosophy. It involves evaluating information, objective analysis of thoughts, skillful application of concepts, and synthesis of ideas.

**Argumentative thinking** - Philosophical thinking involves arguments. Logic takes us from one set of thoughts to another collection of ideas.

**Liberal and inclusive** - Philosophy would have been a disaster if people were not open-minded/ receptive to new ideas and thoughts. Although, sometimes dominant philosophical traditions prevail - Philosophical Blindness.

Philosophical enterprise demands self-scrutiny to eliminate prejudices and dogmas and also competitions - *R. Solomon 2001:100*.

## Metaphysics

Metaphysics was the central idea of philosophical discourse. Philosophy began with metaphysical inquiries. It raises certain fundamental questions regarding the universe and man's existence in it.

Metaphysics talk about everything that exists or may exist. It is also known as *the first philosophy*. 

There were some controversial turning points in the evolution of metaphysics. During the renaissance in the 17th century, the tough-minded philosophers disrupted the glow of metaphysical thinking.

### Aristotle: Metaphysics as First Philosophy

He wrote a Treatise on Metaphysics - *ta meta ta physica*. The Order in First Philosophy is discussed [here](#order-in-first-philosophy) in lecture 3. 

Metaphysics has the power of integrating knowledge across all fields of science. Therefore, it still has relevance in the contemporary world.

Now, we begin studying various philosopher and their philosophies.

## Thales (624-546 BC) - Thales of Miletus

He is known as the First Philosopher. He is the founder of the Ionian School of Science. Thales motivated people to think about reality keeping aside religion and mythical wisdom.

### What did Thales pursue?

He embarked upon the study of things. He awakened people to their awareness. He questioned the existing system of knowledge and the frameworks of misunderstanding. He evoked a desire to find out the right knowledge. 

He wanted to study reality as *it is* and not how it *appears*.

### Everything is Water

Water has no shape, no form of its own. Thales remarked that water is something vital for the generation and growth of all things.
