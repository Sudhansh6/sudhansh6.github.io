## Order of convergence

Let $$\{p_n\}$$ be a sequence that converges to $$p$$ with $$p_n \neq p$$ for any $$n$$. If there are positive constants $$\lambda$$ and $$\alpha$$ such that 


$$
\lim_n \frac{\vert p_{n + 1} - p \vert}{\vert p_n - p \vert^\alpha} = \lambda
$$
then the **order of convergence** of $$\{p_n\}$$ to $$p$$ is $$\alpha$$ with *asymptomatic error* $$\lambda$$. An iterative technique of the form $$p_n = g(p_{n - 1})$$ is said to be of order $$\alpha$$ if the sequence $$\{p_n\}$$ converges to the solution $$p = g(p)$$ with order $$\alpha$$.
