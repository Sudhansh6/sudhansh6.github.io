Hello! I'm Sudhansh, a second-year Masters in Computer Science student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). I am a graduate of [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering with honors and pursued a minor in Entrepreneurship.

       I collaborated with <a href="http://hichristensen.net">Prof. Henrik Christensen</a> on real-time dense 3D SLAM using NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting, along with some traditional techniques. We submitted a conference paper to <a href="https://2025.ieee-icra.org">ICRA '25</a> on a novel table-top rearrangement algorithm with scalable and optimal performance over the existing algorithms.

        At IIT Bombay, I worked with <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/">Prof. Ajit Rajwade</a> on the Likelihood Maximization for Saturated Compressed Sensing. We published a journal paper in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168423004231">Elsevier Signal Processing 2023</a> and a conference paper in <a href="https://2025.ieeeicassp.org">ICASSP '25</a> on permutation error correction in compressed-sensing based group testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also worked with <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/M.Betcke.html">Prof. Marta Betcke</a> from University College London on Stochastic Primal Dual algorithms for Tomographic Reconstruction of 3D volumes in Low-Dose conditions, and we have a journal paper in preparation.

      <p> In summer 2024, I worked as a Computer Vision intern <a href="https://www.duality.ai/">Duality AI</a>, engineering pipelines to import digital twins generated by Gaussian Splatting on Unreal Engine. I also developed algorithms for robust reconstructions from multi-view camera poses of <b>feature-less objects</b>.

      Previously, I worked as a data and applied scientist intern at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/">Microsoft</a>, developing pipelines to generate user-personalized contextual features for Outlook email recommendations.

       As a software engineer intern at <a href="https://finiq.com/">FinIQ</a>, I developed pricing models for financial derivatives, including the Heston stochastic model to backsolve asset volatility. I also contributed to developing a parser to screen email quotations and reduce trade discard rates.
