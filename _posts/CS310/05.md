> ***Homework.*** Find the number of binary strings of length 10 with no two consecutive 1's.

***Example.*** How do we construct an automata which captures the language of binary strings with no two consecutive 1's? We use something known as a **trap state**. All the bad strings will be *trapped* in that state, and no transition from the trap state will lead to a final state. Consider the following automaton.

Here, the 3rd state is the trap state.
