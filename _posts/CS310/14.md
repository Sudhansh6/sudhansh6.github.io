We shall continue discussing simplifying grammars. As an initial step, we can get rid of symbols which are either unreachable or unproductive. However, the order in which we check productivity and reachability affects how the grammar is simplified. For example, consider the grammar

```
S -> a
S -> AB
A -> a
```

Now, if we eliminate unreachable symbols first (that is none), and then eliminate unproductive symbols ($$B$$), we get

```
S -> a
A -> a
```

Notice that the above simplified grammar has a redundant rule. However, if we check for productivity ($$B$$ is eliminated) and then reachability ($$A$$ is unreachable), we get

```
S -> a
```

***Claim.*** Eliminating unproductive symbols followed by unreachable symbols gives a grammar without any useless variables.

> ***Homework.*** Prove the above claim.

### $$\epsilon$$-productions

Suppose $$G$$ is a CFG such that $$L(G)$$ has $$\epsilon$$, then $$L(G) - \{\epsilon\}$$ can be generated by a CFG $$G_1$$ which has no $$\epsilon$$-productions (rules of the form $$A \to \epsilon$$).

### Nullable symbols

$$A$$ is **nullable** if $$A \xrightarrow[G]{*} \epsilon$$.
