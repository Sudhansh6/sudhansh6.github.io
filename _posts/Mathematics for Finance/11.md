$$(\implies)$$ Now, we show the opposite direction, that is for a viable market, there exists an EMM. 

We have $$\#(\Omega) < \infty$$, where $$\Omega = \{w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n\}$$. Consider a random variable $$X: \Omega \to \mathbb R$$, then we have $$(X(w_1), X(w_2), \dots, X(w_n) \in \mathbb R^n)$$ and a distribution $$Q$$ with probabilities $$(Q(w_1), \dots, Q(w_n))$$. Then, we have

$$
\mathbb E^Q(V^*_T(\phi)) = \sum_{k = 1}^n Q(w_k) V^*_T(\phi) (w_k) = Q \cdot V^*_T(\phi)
$$

It suffices to show that there exists a $$Q$$ such that $$Q \perp \{V_T^*(\phi): \phi \text{ is a trading strategy with } V_0(\phi) = 0\} \subset \mathbb R^n\}$$. 

We have seen before that as a result of a telscopric sum formulation, $$V^*_T(\phi) = V_0^*(\phi) + \sum_{u = 1}^T \phi_u \cdot \Delta S_u^*$$. 

**Lemma 2**

Suppose a $$M = (M_1, \dots, M_n)$$ is an adapted sequence such that 

$$
\mathbb E\left(\sum_{u = 1}^T q_u \cdot \Delta M_u\right) = 0; \quad \Delta M_k = M_k = M_{k - 1}
$$

for all predictable $$(q_1, \dots, q_T)$$, then $$M$$ is a martingale. 

*Proof.* To show, $$\mathbb E(M_t \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1}) = M_{t - 1}$$ for $$t = 1, 2, \dots, T$$. Equivalently, $$\mathbb E(M_t \cdot \mathbb 1_A) = \mathbb E(M_{t - 1} \cdot \mathbb 1_A)$$ for all $$A \in \mathcal F_{t - 1}$$. 

If $$X, Y$$ are both $$\mathcal G$$-measurable and $$\mathbb E(X \cdot \mathbb 1_A) = \mathbb E(Y \cdot \mathbb 1_A)$$ for all $$A \in \mathcal G$$, then $$P(X = Y) = 1$$ (Consider $$\{X < Y\} = A$$).

In our context $$X = \mathbb E(M_t \vert \mathcal F_{t - 1})$$ and $$Y = M_{t - 1}$$, leading to $$\mathbb (\Delta M_t \cdot \mathbb 1_A) = 0$$.  Fixing $$t$$ and $$A \in \mathcal F_{t - 1}$$, let

$$
q_u = \begin{cases}
    \mathbb 1_A & u = t \\
0 & u \neq t
\end{cases}
$$

Consequently,

$$
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{u = 1}^T q_u \cdot \Delta M_u = \mathbb 1_A \cdot (M_t - M_{t - 1})
\end{align*}
$$

**Lemma 3** If we have, $$q_t^i \in \mathcal F_{t - 1}$$ for $$i = 1, \dots, d$$ amd $$t = 1, \dots, T$$, then for any $$c \in \mathbb R$$,  there exists $$\phi^0_t$$ for $$t = 1, \dots, T$$ such that

$$
\phi = \{(\phi_t^0, \phi_t^1, \dots, \phi_t^d): t = 1, \dots, T\}
$$

is a **self-financing** trading strategy and $$V_0(\phi) = c$$.

**Proposition.** Suppose $$Q \sim P$$, such that $$\mathbb E^Q(V_T^*(\phi)) = 0$$ for all trading strategies $$\phi$$ with $$V_0(\phi) = 0$$, then $$Q$$ is an EMM. That is, we need to show $$S^{1*}_t$$ is a Q-martingale. From lemma 2, it is equivalent to showing $$\mathbb E^Q(\sum_{u = 1}^T q_u \cdot \Delta S_u^{1*}) = 0$$ for all $$(q_1, \dots, q_T)$$. Consider the following strategy

$$
\phi^i_t = \begin{cases}
q_t & i = 1 \\
0 & i = 2, 3, \dots, d \\
\phi_t^0 \text{ from Lemma 3}
\end{cases}
$$

 Then, 

$$
\begin{align*}
\sum_{u = 1}^T q_u \Delta M_u &= \mathbb 1_A (M_t - M_{t - 1}) \\
V^*_T(\phi) &= \sum_{i = 0}^d \sum_{u = 1}^T (\phi_u^i \cdot S_u^{i*}) \\
&= \sum_{u = 1}^T q_u \cdot \Delta S_u^{1*}
\end{align*}
$$

Now, for all trading strategies with the self-financing property, the set $$L:= {V_T^*(\phi): \phi \text{ with } V_0(\phi) = 0} \subset \mathbb R^n$$ is a linear subspace of $$\mathbb R^n$$.  Similarly, consider the set $$D := \{Y \in \mathbb R^n : Y \geq 0 \text{ with } Y \neq 0\}$$. 

Our goal boils down to show that a viable market exists if and only if $$L \cap D = \phi$$. It is equivalent to show $$L \cap F = \phi$$ for $$F:= \{Y \in D: \sum_{i = 1}^n Y_k = 1\}$$.
