We have seen that

$$
V_t(\phi) = e^{rt} f(S_t^*, t)
$$

We have

$$
f(x, t) = x \Phi\left(\frac{\log{(x/K^*)}}{\sigma \sqrt{T - t}} + \frac{\sigma \sqrt{T - t}}{2}\right) - K^* \Phi\left(\frac{\log(x/K^*)}{\sigma \sqrt{T - t}} - \frac{\sigma \sqrt{T - t}}{2}\right)
$$

where $$X = (S_t - K)^+, K^* = Ke^{-rT}, \Phi =$$ standard normal CDF. Here, $$f$$ is smooth in the sense that it is twice differentiable in $$S_t^*$$ and differentiable in $$t$$. Using Ito's formula, since $$V_t^*(\phi)$$ is a martingale,

$$
V_t^*(\phi) = V_0^*(\phi) + \int_0^t \underbrace{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} (S_u^*, u)}_{\alpha_u} dS_u^* + \cdots
$$

 The remaining integral terms cancel out to $$0$$

> Why?

Consequently,

$$
\begin{align*}
\alpha_t &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} (S_t^*, t) = \Phi\left(\frac{\log(S_t^*/K^*)}{\sigma \sqrt{T - t}} + \frac{\sigma \sqrt{T - t}}{2}\right) \\
\beta_t &= V_t^*(\phi) - \alpha_t S_t^*
\end{align*}
$$

We can check that when $$S_T > K, \alpha_t \to 1$$, and $$S_T < K, \alpha_t \to 0$$. 

Let $$X^* = g(S_T^*)$$, then, $$V_T^*(\phi) = f(S_t^*, t) = \mathbb E^*(g(S_t^*) \vert \mathcal F_t)$$ and $$\lim_{t \uparrow T} f(x, t) = g(x)$$

Also,

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 x^2 \frac{\partial^ f}{\partial x^2} \equiv 0
$$

for $$(x, t) \in (0, \infty) \times [0, T)$$. This PDE has a unique solutions when $$g$$ has certain properties.

## Black-Scholes Formula

Consider the market with the assets $$S_t = (S_t^0, S_t^1, \dots, S_t^d)$$ where $$S_t^0 = B_t = e^{\int_0^t r_s ds}$$ and $$(r_s)_{0 \leq s \leq T}$$ is a progressive process ($$r_s \geq 0, \int_0^t r_s ds < \infty$$). This formulation maintains $$\frac{d S_t^0}{S_t^0} = r_t dt$$. 

- The stocks have drifts $$\mu_t^1 , \dots, \mu_t^d$$ which are progressive processes and $$\int_0^T \vert \mu_t^i \vert dt < \infty$$ for all $$i$$. 

- The volatilities are represented as a matrix $$\sigma^T = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^1 &\sigma^2 & \dots & \sigma^d \end{bmatrix}$$ ($$d \times n$$) where $$\sigma_t^{ij}$$ is progressive and $$\int_0^T \|\sigma_t^i\|^2 dt < \infty$$. 

- $$W = (W^1, \dots, W^n)$$ are independent 1-dimensional standard Brownian Motions.

Using these elements, the price process is defined as

$$
S_t^i = S_0^i \exp\left(\int_0^t \sigma_u^i \cdot dW_u - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^t \vert \sigma_u^i \vert ^2 du + \int_0^t \mu_u^i du\right)
$$

Then, the using the basic definitions, a trading strategy is $$\phi_t = (\phi_t^0, \dots, \phi_t^d)$$ and 

$$
\begin{align*}
V_t(\phi) &= \phi_t \cdot S_t\\
&= V_0(\phi) + \int_0^t \phi_u \cdot dS_u \quad \because \text{self financing} \\
\equiv V_t^*(\phi) - V_0(\phi) &= \sum_{i = 1}^d \int_0^t \phi_u^i dS_u^{i, *}
\end{align*}
$$

Also, given any strategy $$\tilde \phi = (\tilde \phi_t^1, \dots, \tilde \phi_t^d)$$ which is progressive and integrable and $$c \in \mathbb R$$, representing the initial holdings, there exists $$\phi_t^0$$ such that 

$$\phi_t = (\phi_t^0, \tilde \phi_t^1, \dots, \tilde \phi_t^d)$$ is a self-financing trading strategy $$V_0(\phi) = c$$.
