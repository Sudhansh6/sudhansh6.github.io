Dialectic is a form of reasoning. It's the method of connecting different ideas and generalising stuff. We shall start discussing about Aristotle now. Aristotle is the disciple of Plato and the mentor of Alexander the Great. He made great contributions to science as a discipline. He formalised the realm of deductive reasoning, a direct extension to Plat's conceptual understanding. *Causal explanation* is another great contribution of Aristotle. Aristotle believed form and matter are inseparable.

## Aristotle (384 - 322 BC)

He is known for Metaphysics, Syllogism and Virtue Ethics. Aristotle made a distinction between metaphysics and science.

### Aristotle's Problem

Aristotle believed that love of wisdom must be the sole aim of philosophers but they must be consistent and scientific. There was a lack of scientific explanation in Plato Philosophy which Aristotle sought to address. He questioned Plato's conception of forms/ideas, and denied the division between ideal and material.

Ethics is anti-hedonistic and intuitive. Aristotle considered Happiness and Pleasure are different, which is opposite of what Plato thought. 

> Hedonistic - Engaging in the pursuit of pleasure; sensually self-indulgent

According to Aristotle, form and particulars are not different. Plato doesn't talk about progressive change of forms as he believed they were eternal. However, Aristotle tried to include change through the "Theory of Causation".

- Forms are not apart from things, but inherent in them; they are not transcendent, but immanent.
- Form and matter are not separate but eternally together: matter combines with the form to constitute individual things
- The phenomenal world is not a mere imitation or copy/ shadows of the real world. Rather it is the real world!
- Aristotle advocated realism and encouraged natural science

The above points summarise how different Aristotle was in comparison to Plato.

## Philosophy and the Sciences

Organic and teleological viewpoint of the universe. Everything in the universe has a purpose, and that is how the world came into being. He believed experience is the basis of knowledge. Saying that, he thought reason and experience are not very different. Genuine knowledge is not mere acquaintance with facts, but knowing their reasons and causes. Philosophy and science in a broad sense have a rational basis. Science studies the first cause of things.

## Metaphysics

Study of all things as their beings. Study of first philosophy. Study of *qua being*.

`How is this different from Ontolgy?`

A thing is a thing by virtue of something that it is. That is, every thing with a form has a function.

## Classification of Sciences

- Logic - Method of inquiry employed in all other sciences
- Theoretical Sciences - Pure abstract knowledge - Maths, Physics, Biology
- Practical Sciences - Knowledge by means of conduct - Ethics, Politics
- Productive Sciences - Knowledge is subordinated by the criterion of beauty, Aristotle's *poetics* is an investigation in this sphere of aesthetics.
