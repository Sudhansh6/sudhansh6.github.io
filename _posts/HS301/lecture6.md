# Lecture 6 `05/08/21`

We will study Pythagoras in this lecture. We are still in the pre-Socratic period.

## Pythagoras

He believed numbers could be used to explain the reality. His thoughts were unique and created a blend - Mysticism and Mathematics. He also loved music. Mathematics maintains demonstrative deductive arguments.

### Philosophical Contribution

He introduced the concept of deciphering the inner working of the mind/ purification of intellectual and perceptual abilities.

Self-evidence is a deeply influential notion and Pythagoras applied to the perspectives of moral claims. He introduced the Axiomatic method. Axioms were self-evident/ fundamental propositions.
