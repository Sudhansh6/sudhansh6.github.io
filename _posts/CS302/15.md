### Generating IR for Field Accesses in a Structure

The ‘access’ expressions become a little more non-trivial in case of structures as compared to variables. The memory offsets of a structure can be computed at compile time unlike an array offset. For example, the offset in `A[x]` cannot be calculated at compile time. Hence, it is easier to work on structures. A float is considered to occupy 8 bytes.

The general IR code will have the following steps

- Obtain the base address
- Add the offset to the base
- Dereference the resulting address

We will assume `offset(t, f)` gives the offset of field `f` in structure `t`. Similarly, `type(t, f)` gives the type of `f` in `t`. The TAC generation code is given by

We need to add the `code` and `place` attributes to the above rules. We shall assume that the members of a class are stored sequentially based on the declaration. 

**Note.** We cannot have a circular dependancy among classes without pointers.

We shall introduce pointers in our grammar now.

**Note.** The new code for $$F \to id_1.id_2$$ generates different code as compared to our previous implementation. 

## Syntax Directed Translation Schemes

Given a production $$X \to Y_1Y_2 \dots Y_k$$,

- If an attribute $$X.a$$ is computed from those of $$Y_i$$, $$1 \leq i \leq k$$, the $$X.a$$ is a **synthesised attribute**.
- If an attribute $$Y_i.a$$, $$1 \leq i \leq k$$ is computed from those of $$X$$ or $$Y_j$$,  $$1 \leq j \leq i$$, then $$Y_i.a$$ is an **inherited attribute**.

Using these definitions, we will come up with an alternate approach for generating the IR for structures that is more expressive.
