> Does a rule of the form $$T \to \epsilon$$ always lead to a shift-reduce conflict?

Consider $$\beta Aw \xrightarrow{rm} \beta \alpha w$$. When do we reduce occurrence of $$\alpha$$ in $$\beta\alpha$$ using $$A \to \alpha$$ using LR($$k$$)? (When do we decide that $$\alpha$$ and $$A \to \alpha$$ form a handle in $$\beta \alpha$$).

- As soon as we find $$\alpha$$ in $$\beta \alpha$$ - LR(0) items and no lookahead in the input - **SLR(0) Parser**
- As soon as we find $$\alpha$$ in $$\beta \alpha$$ and the next input token can follow $$A$$ in some right sentential form - LR(0) items and 1 lookahead in the input - **SLR(1) Parser**
- As soon as we find $$\alpha$$ in $$\beta \alpha$$ and the next input token can follow $$A$$ in $$\beta \alpha$$ - LR(1) items and 1 lookahead in the input - **CLR(1) Parser**

To formalise the notion of follow, we defined `FIRST` and `FOLLOW` sets.

`FIRST`$$(\beta)$$ contains the terminals that may begin a string derivable from $$\beta$$. If $$\beta$$ derives $$\epsilon$$ then $$\epsilon \in FIRST(\beta)$$.
