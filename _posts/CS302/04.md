Creating a lexical analyzer

- Hand code - possible more efficient but seldom used nowadays.
- Use a generator - Generates from formal description. Less prone to errors.

A formal description of the tokens of the source language will consist of

- A regular expression describing each token, and
- A code fragment called an **action routine** describing the action to be performed, on identifying each token.

Some regex notation - 

- Alternation is represented using `|`
- Grouping is done via parentheses
- `+` is positive closure and `*` is Kleene closure

The generator, such as Lex, puts together 

- A **DFA** constructed from the token specification
- A code fragment called a **driver routine** which can traverse any DFA
- **Action routines** associated with each regular expression.

Usually, the lexeme with the longest matching pattern is taken into consideration.

## Regular Expressions

A regular expression is a set of strings (*a language*) that belongs to set formed the following rules

- $$\epsilon$$ and single letters are regular expressions.
- If $$r, s$$ are regular expressions, then $$r\vert s$$ is a regular expression. That is, $$L(r\vert s) = L(r) \cup L(s)$$
- If $$r,s$$ are regular expressions, then $$rs$$ is a regular expression. That is, $$L(rs) =$$ concatenation of strings in $$L(r)$$ and $$L(s)$$.
- If $$r$$ is a regular expression then $$r^*$$ is a regular expression. That is, $$L(r^*)$$ is the concatenation of zero or more strings from $$L(r)$$. Similarly, for $$r^+$$
- If $$r$$ is a regular expression, then so is $$(r)$$.

The syntax of regular expressions according to Lex is given as

The return statements in the action routines are useful when a lexical analyzer is used in conjunction with a parser. Some conventions followed by lexical analyzers are

- Starting from an input position, detect the longest lexeme that could match a pattern.
- If a lexeme matches more than one pattern, declare the lexeme to have matched the earliest pattern.

### Lexical errors

There are primarily three kinds of errors. 

- Lexemes whose length exceeds the bound specified by the language. Most languages have a bound on the precision of numeric constants. This problem is due to the finite size of parse tables.
- Illegal characters in the program. 
- Unterminated strings or comments.

We could issue an appropriate error message to handle errors.
