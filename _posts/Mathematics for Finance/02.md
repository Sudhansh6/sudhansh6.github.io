## Binomial Model
Also known as **Cox-Ross-Rubenstein Model (CRR)** considers the following two types of assets
#### Bonds
Considered as a risk-free asset, the price is modeled as
$$B_t = B_0 (1 + r)^t$$
for $$t = 0, 1, \dots, T$$. 

#### Stocks
Stocks are considered as risk-models where the price evolution is captured using binomial random variables. We consider the model
$$ S_t = s_o \zeta_1 \dots \zeta_{t_1} = S_{t - 1} \zeta_t $$
where $$S_0 > 0$$ is the constant intial price. In this model, we assume $$P(\zeta_t = u) = p$$ and $$P(\zeta_t = d) = 1- p$$ where $$0 < d < 1 + r < u $$ where $$d, u$$ are the down and up movements respectively. 

Let the field $$\mathcal F_0 = \{ \phi, \Omega\}$$ and 
$$ \begin{align*}
	\mathcal F_1 &= \sigma(S_1) \\
	&= \{ \phi, \Omega, \{w: S_1(w) = S_0u \}, \{w: s_(1) = S_0 d\}\} \\
	&= \sigma(\{S_1 = S_0u\}), \{S_1 = S_0d\})
\end{align*} $$

This is a partition of $$\Omega$$. Similarly, for $$t = 2$$, we get $$\mathcal F_1 = \{ \phi, \Omega, \{uu, ud\}, \{dd, du\}\}$$. EXtrapolating this,
$$ \mathcal F_t = \sigma(S_1, \dots, S_t) = \sigma(\zeta_2, \dots, \zeta_t) $$
We get $$\#(\mathcal F)_t = 2^t$$. 

This evolution can be represented using a binomial tree of the following form -
