abstract = {Practical sensing systems have a limited dynamic range, which gives rise to saturation noise in signal acquisition if the signal attains values outside this range at certain locations. Despite rapid advances in compressed sensing theory and systems over the years, the effect of saturation on compressed sensing measurements, especially in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, has often been overlooked in many existing approaches.  In this paper, we propose a novel maximum likelihood based estimator for compressive reconstruction in the presence of both Gaussian and saturation noise. },
