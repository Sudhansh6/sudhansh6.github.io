We shall study about the Socratic period. This phase of philosophy consists of 3 main philosophers - Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. How do Epistemology and Metaphysics differ? How does Ontology fit in? We shall discuss about it now

## Before the Arrival of Socrates

Men-centric philosophy prevailed during this period. The Greek society developed in the fields of Greek history, Poetry, and Medicine. People generally believed in divinity and occult mystical powers. Also, the zeal of investigation was intense. However, Socrates sought for morals and ethics. He didn't want to blindly follow the existing beliefs, and wanted to discover his own version of the truth.

This age also saw the rise of spirit of independent reflection and criticism. People tried to avoid the false paths, and departed from the school of speculative thought. 

## The beginning of the Socratic period

There was a shift in the way of philosophical thinking. There was an establishment of Democratic institution fostered in the new age in Athens. Traditional religion, morality, science, etc. were subject to criticism. There was an other city which gave less importance to knowledge and gave more importance to power - Spartan. 

*Subjectivism* is the theory that talks about each individual's perception. If one tries to assert his truth as the only true truth, then there would be chaos. 

**Sophists** - A representative of New Movement in Greece. Socrates was a part of this group. However, Socrates was executed because he defied the truth of the group. More on that later. Sophists were wise and skillful, professional teachers, travellers, etc. They used to train people in **dialectics, grammar, rhetorism,** and **oratory**. Sophists had great communication skills.

"Every individual has the ability to measure things" - *Protagoras*.

Socrates believed an unexamined life is not worth leading.
