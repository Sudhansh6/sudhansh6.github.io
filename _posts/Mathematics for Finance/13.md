    Now, it is left to show that there exists a $$c$$ such that $$\tilde Q(w_k) > 0$$. Consider the following formulation

$$
c:= \frac{1}{2 \max_{1 \leq k \leq n} \left(\frac{\|z_k\|}{Q(w_k)}\right)}
$$

Then,

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2c} &= \max_k \left(\frac{\|z_k\|}{Q(w_k}\right) \\
Q(w_k) &\geq 2c \|z_k\|  \\
\tilde Q(w_k) &= Q(w_k) + cz_k \\
&\geq 2c \|z_k\| + cz_k > 0
\end{align*}
$$

Finally, to show that $$\tilde Q$$ is an EMM,

$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb E^{\tilde Q}(V_T^*(\phi)) &\stackrel{?}{=} 0 \quad \text{ if} V_0(\phi) = 0\\
    &= \mathbb E^Q (V_T^*(\phi)) + c z \cdot V_T^*(\phi) \quad \because z \perp L \\
&= 0
\end{align*}
$$

This proves the second fundamental theorem of asset pricing.

Note that if $$Q_1, Q_2$$ are two EMMs, then a linear combination of these $$\alpha Q_1(A) + (1 - \alpha) Q_2(A)$$ for $$A \in \mathcal F$$ and $$0<\alpha<1$$ is also an EMM.

### Example

For $$T = 1, \Omega = \{w_1, w_2,w_3\}$$, let $$S_1^0 = S_0^0 = 1$$, $$S_0^1 = 2$$ and $$S_1^1 = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 3 & 5\end{pmatrix}^T$$. To check if the market is viable, we try and solve for an EMM on this market - Let $$Q = (a, b, c)$$, then

$$
\begin{align*}
a + b + c = 1, a > 0,b>0,c>0\\
a + 3b + 5c = 2
\end{align*}
$$

Solving, we get

$$
Q^{(c)} = \left(\frac{1}{2} + c, \frac{1}{2} - 2c, c\right)
$$

for $$0 < c < \frac{1}{4}$$. This shows that the market is viable. Also, the market is not viable since there are multiple EMMs possible.

For a contingent claim $$X$$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb E^{(c)}(X^*) &= \left(\frac{1}{2} + c\right)x_1 + \left(\frac{1}{2} - 2c\right)x_2 + cx_3 \\
&= \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} + c (x_1 + x_3 - 2x_2) 
\end{align*}
$$

That means, when $$x_1 + x_3 - 2x_2$$ is $$0$$, then the expectation is independent of $$c$$ - $$X$$ can be replicated in some cases even if the market is incomplete!

Let us try an replicate such an $$X$$. Consider the bond holdings $$\alpha$$ and stock holdings $$\beta$$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\alpha S_1^1 + \beta S_1^0 &= X \\
\alpha \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 3 \\ 5\end{pmatrix} + \beta \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

$$X$$ is replicable iff $$X \in \text{span}(\begin{pmatrix}1 & 3 & 5\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & 1\end{pmatrix}) \equiv X \perp \begin{pmatrix}1 & -2 & 1\end{pmatrix}$$. This again yields $$x_1 + x_3 - 2x_2$$.

**Theorem.** In a viable and complete market, the number V_0(\phi) is the no-arbitrage price of a European Call Clain X = V_T(\phi).

*Note.* We have seen this before in the context of a binomial model, but this theorem is for a general market with discrete possibilities. In our previous proof, we did not use any binomial properties but rather showed the result using martingale properties. The same proof follows for this as well.

How do we conclude such results in a general case? Even when the market is incomplete, how do we find contingent claims which can be replicated?

Consider the set $$M = \{Q: Q \text{ is an EMM}\} \neq \phi$$. Then for any measure in this set,

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb E^Q(V_T^*(\phi)) &= V_0^*(\phi) \\
& = \frac{V_0(\phi)}{S_0^0} 
\end{align*}
$$

Now, for a contingent claim X, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
V_+(X)&:= \inf \{V_0(\phi):V_T(\phi)\geq X\} \\
&=  \min \{V_0(\phi):V_T(\phi)\geq X\} \\
\hline
\mathbb E^Q(X^*) &\leq \mathbb E^Q(V_T^*(\phi)) \sout{S_T^0} = V_0(\phi) \frac{\sout{S_T^0}}{S_0^0} \\
&\leq \frac{1}{S_0^0} V_+(X)
\end{align*}
$$

Similarly,

$$
\begin{align*}
V_-(X)&:= \sup \{V_0(\phi):V_T(\phi)\geq X\} \\
&=  \max \{V_0(\phi):V_T(\phi)\geq X\} \\
\hline \\
V_-(X) &\leq S_0^0 \mathbb E^Q(X^*) \leq V_+ (X)
\end{align*}
$$

Suppose $$X$$ is replicable, then $$X = V_T(\tilde \phi)$$ for some $$\tilde \phi$$. Then,

$$
\begin{align*}
V_0(\tilde\phi) \geq V_+(X), V_0(\tilde\phi) \leq V_-(X) \\
V_-(X) \leq V_+(X)
\end{align*}
$$

leading to $$V_+(X) = V_-(X)$$!

Does the converse hold? In the previous example, say we have a contingent claim $$X = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 9 & 25\end{pmatrix} = (S_1^1)^2$$. Now consider a strategy $$\phi = (\alpha, \beta)$$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
V_0(\phi) &= 2\alpha + \beta  \\
V_1^1(\phi) &\leq X \quad \text{ for } V_-(X) \\ 
\alpha \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\5 \end{pmatrix} + \beta \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix} &\leq \begin{pmatrix}1 \\9 \\ 25\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

Solving these inequalities, we get $$V_-(X) = 5$$, and similarly, $$V_+(X) = 7$$. Let us check if $$X$$ can be replicated

$$
\mathbb E^{(c)}(X) = 5 + 8c, 0 < c< \frac{1}{4}
$$

It is not possible for the expectation to be independent of $$c$$. Also note that the range of the above expression is exactly $$(5, 7)$$.
