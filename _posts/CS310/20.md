### $$\epsilon$$ closure

We define $$\epsilon$$ closure for a state $$q$$ in a DFA as all the states that $$q$$ can reach via $$\epsilon$$ transitions. Then, to remove all the $$\epsilon$$ transitions from $$q$$, we add a transition corresponding to all transitions from $$q$$ to each of the states in the $$\epsilon$$ closure of $$q$$. Also, if any state in the $$\epsilon$$ closure of $$q$$ is final, then $$q$$ can also be made as a final state.

**Note.** Minimal DFAs need not be unique. They are isomorphic.
