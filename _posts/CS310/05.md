***Example.*** How do we construct an automata which captures the language of binary strings with no two consecutive 1's? We use something known as a **trap state**. All the bad strings will be *trapped* in that state, and no transition from the trap state will lead to a final state. Consider the following automaton.

Here, the 3rd state is the trap state.

### Extended transition function

$$\hat \delta : Q \times\Sigma^* \to 2^Q$$ is defined as


$$
\hat \delta(S, aW) = 
\begin{cases}
		\delta(S, a) & w = \epsilon \\
		\hat \delta(\delta(S, a), W) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$


For the sake of convenience we drop the hat and use $$\delta$$ for the extended function (polymorphism).

> ***Homework.*** Read the proof for showing the equivalence of language sets in DFA.

## Non-determinism

Non-determinism basically refers to the procedures where we get the same output from the same input through *multiple runs*. In **don’t care** non-determinism, we get the same output with different algorithms/procedures. However, in **don’t know** non-determinism, a single stochastic algorithm goes through many runs (scenarios) to get the answer.
