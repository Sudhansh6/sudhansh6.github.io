## Basic Query Structure

- A typical SQL query has the form:

```sql
select A1, A2, ..., An
from r1, r2, ..., rm
where P
```

â€‹	where, $$A_i$$ are attributes, $$r_i$$ are relations, and $$P$$ has conditions/predicates.

- We shall be using PostgreSQL for the rest of the course.
- SQL names are usually case insensitive. Some databases are case insensitive even in string comparison!
- To force the elimination of duplicates, insert the keyword `distinct` after select. Duplicates come from 
  1. Input itself is a multiset
  2. Joining tables
- SQL allows renaming relations and attributes using the `as` clause. We can skip `as` in some databases like Oracle. Also, some databases allow queries with no `from` clause.
- **Self Join**: How do we implement various levels of recursion without loops and only imperative statements? Usually, `union` is sufficient for our purposes. However, this is infeasible in case of large tables or higher levels of hierarchy.
- SQL also includes string operations. The operator `like` uses patterns that are describes using two special character - `percent %` - Matches any substring and `underscore _` matches any character (Use `\` as the escape character). Some databases even fully support regular expressions. Most databases also support `ilike` which is case-insensitive.
- Use `order by` for sorting.
