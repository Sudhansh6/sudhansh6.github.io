### Properties of shift-reduce parsers

Is the following situation possible?

- $$\alpha \beta \gamma$$ is the stack content, and $$A\to \gamma$$ is the handle.
- The stack content reduces to $$\alpha \beta A$$
- Now, $$B \to \beta$$ in the next handle.

Notice that the handle is buried in the stack. The search for the handle can be expensive. If this is true, then there is a sequence of rightmost derivations 


$$
S \xrightarrow{*rm} \alpha BAxyz \xrightarrow{rm} \alpha \beta Axyz \xrightarrow{rm} \alpha \beta \gamma xyz
$$


However, this is not a valid rightmost derivation. Therefore, the above scenario is not possible.

This property does not ensure unique reductions with SR parser. For example, we can have the following.

These problems are collectively grouped as shift-reduce conflicts and reduce-reduce conflicts. Given a parsing table, each (state, char) pair can have two possible valid actions. These conflicts are resolved by conventionally choosing one action over the other.

## Simple Right to Left Parsing (SLR(1))

Shift reduce parsing is a precursor to this parsing method. As in, shift reduce parsing does not have a definitive algorithm as such, and it is formalized using SLR parsing.

### Shift Reduce Parsing: Formal Algorithms

The first step involves disambiguating the grammar. Shift reduce conflicts are resolved using **precedence** and **associativity**. As we have seen, we trace right most derivations in reverse by identifying handles in right sentential forms and *pruning* them for constructing the previous right sentential form.

How do we identify handles? <u>We need to discover a prefix of right sentential form that ends with a handle.</u> 

A **viable prefix** of a right sentential form that does not extend beyond the handle. It is either a string with no handle, or it is a string that ends with a handle. By suffixing terminal symbols to the viable prefix of the second kind, we can create a right sentential form. <u>The set of viable prefixes forms a regular language (as they are prefixes), thus they can be recognised by a DFA</u>. We keep pushing prefixes on the stack until the handle appears on the top of the stack.

The occurrence of a potential handle does not mean it should be reduced, the next terminal symbol decides whether it is an actual handle. In general, the set of viable prefixes need not be finite and the DFA to recognise them may have cycles.

An item is a grammar production with a dot ($$\bullet$$) in it somewhere in the RHS. The dot separates what has been seen from what may be seen in the input  . It can be used to identify a set of items for a viable prefix. A terminal to the left of the dot indicates a *complete item*. 

Now, we shall see how to compute **LR(0) item sets**. `L` means that it reads the input left to right, `R` denotes that it traces the rightmost derivation in reverse, and `0` tells that an item does no contain any lookahead symbol. Consider the grammar 


$$
\begin{align}
E \to E + E \mid E*E \mid id
\end{align}
$$
 

We augment the grammar by adding a synthetic start symbol. Then we construct the start state by putting a dot at the start of the start symbol and taking a closure. We then identify the transitions on every symbol that has a dot before it to construct new states. For every state identified in this manner, we take a closure and identify the transitions on every symbol that has a dot before it.
