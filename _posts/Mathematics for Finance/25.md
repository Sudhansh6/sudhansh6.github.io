With that, we now state the **Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing** for continuous models -

**Theorem (SFTAP)**. Suppose there exists an ELMM $$P^*$$. Then, the market is complete if the ELMM is unique. By complete, we mean that for all contingent claims $$X^* \in L^1 (P^*)$$, there is a self-financing trading strategy such that $$X = V_T(\phi)$$.

*Proof.* 

$$(\implies)$$ Let $$Q$$ be another ELMM, then for $$A \in \mathcal F_T$$, we define $$\mathbb 1_A = X^* \in L^1(P^*)$$. That is, $$X = S_T^0 \mathbb 1_A$$ (let $$S_0^0 = 1$$).

$$
\begin{align*}
X^* &= V_T^*(\phi) \\
\mathbb E^*(V_T^*(\phi)) &= \mathbb E^*(V_0^*(\phi)) =  V_0(\phi)  = P^*(A)
\end{align*}
$$

Also, $$V_t^*(\phi), 0\leq t\leq T$$ is a $$Q$$-local martingale

$$
V_t^* = V_0(\phi) + \int_0^t \phi_s dS_s^*
$$

Since the claim is replicable and $$X^* \geq 0$$, $$V_t^*(\phi) = \mathbb E^*(X^* \vert \mathcal F_t) \geq 0$$. Since $$V_t^*(\phi)$$ is a $$Q$$-local martingale, it is also a $$Q$$-supermartingale -

$$
P^*(A) =V_0(\phi) \geq \mathbb E^Q(V_T^*(\phi)) = \mathbb E^Q(X^*) = Q(A)
$$

We have $$P^*(A) \geq Q(A)$$ for all $$A \in \mathcal F_T$$. Also, $$1 - P^*(A) \geq 1 - Q(A)$$ as well, implying $$P^* = Q$$.

$$(\Longleftarrow)$$ Assume $$P^*$$ is the only ELMM. Let $$X^* \in L^1(P^*)$$. The martingale

$$
M_t = \mathbb E^*(X^* \vert \mathcal F_T), 0 \leq t \leq T
$$

is right-continuous (continuous). From the martingale representation theorem, there is a unique progressive process $$\eta_u = (\eta_u^1, \dots, \eta_u^d)$$ such that

$$
M_t = M_0 + \int_0^t \eta_u \cdot dS_u^*
$$

Now, correspondingly, there exists a unique self-financing trading strategy $$\phi = (\phi_t^0, \eta_t^1, \dots, \eta_t^d)$$ such that $$V_0(\phi) = M_0$$ and

$$
X^* = V_0(\phi) + \int_0^T \phi_u \cdot dS_u^*
$$

> How does the proof conclude here?

From Girsanov's theorem, we have seen that 

$$
S_t^{i,*} = S_0^i \exp\left(\int_0^t \sigma_s^i \cdot d\tilde W_ + \int_0^t \vert \sigma_s^i \vert^2 ds + \int_0^t \mu_s^i dst\right)
$$

where $$\sigma_s^i$$ is the $$i$$th row of $$\sigma_s$$ which itself is a $$(d \times n)$$ matrix. We typically assume $$d \leq n$$ meaning that we want enough randomness to represent the stocks.

Then, we have the following result -

**Lemma.** The market is complete **iff** $$d = n$$ and $$\sigma(w)$$ is invertible

*Proof.*

$$(\Longleftarrow)$$ This is trivial to show

$$(\implies)$$ Let $$k_t(w) \in \mathcal n(\sigma_t(w))$$ where $$\mathcal n$$ represents the nullspace operation. Also, let $$\|k_t(w) \|\leq 1$$ and $$\|k_t(w) \| > 0$$ if $$\mathcal n(\sigma_t(w)) \neq \{0\}$$. Then, let

$$
X = S_T^0 (1 + \int_0^T k_u \cdot d \tilde W_u)
$$

Since the second term is always a local martingale, and $$\|k\|\leq 1$$, it's norm is finite and therefore is a martingale. Also, $$\mathbb E^*(X^*) = 1$$.

The market being complete means, $$X^* = 1 + \int_0^T \phi_u \cdot dS_u^*$$ for some trading strategy $$\phi$$. Equating both the equations, we get

$$
\begin{align*}
\int_0^T \left(k_t - \sum_{i = 1}^d \phi_t^i S_t^{i, *} \sigma_t^i\right) \cdot d\tilde W_t &= 0 \\
\int_0^T \left\vert k_t - \sum_{i = 1}^d \phi_t^i S_t^{i, *} \sigma_t^i\right\vert^2 &= 0 \\
k_t = \sum_{i = 1}^d \phi_t^i S_t^{i, ^*} \sigma_t^i
\end{align*}
$$

implying that the vector $$k_t(w)$$ is in the column space of $$\sigma_t(w) ^T$$. For a matrix $$B$$, the orthogonal subspace of $$\mathcal R(B^{T})$$ denoted by $$[\mathcal R(B^T)]^{\perp} = \mathcal n(B)$$. Therefore, $$k_t(w) \perp \mathcal n(\sigma_t(w))$$ implying that $$k_t(w) = 0$$!

How do we conclude $$n = d$$? If $$d < n$$, then the matrix would not be full rank, implying $$d = n$$.

**Theorem** If a market is viable and complete, then the no-arbitrage price of $$X$$ (assuming $$X$$ is integrable $$\in L^1(P^*)$$) at time $$t$$ is

$$
V_t(\phi) = S_t^0 \mathbb E^*(X^* \vert \mathcal F_t)
$$

The proof is similar to the ones we have shown before, and this theorem completes the whole picture of a continuous market.

Consider the Black-Scholes model where we had 

$$
X^* = g(S_T^*)
$$

We had calculated $$\mathbb E^*(g(S_T^*) \vert \mathcal F_t) = f(S_t^*, t)$$ where

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x, t) &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x\exp(\alpha z - \alpha^2/2)), x> 0\\
&= \int_0^\infty g(y) \phi\left(\frac{\log(y/s)}{\alpha} + \frac{\alpha}{2}\right) \frac{dy}{\alpha y}
\end{align*}
$$

where $$\alpha = \sigma \sqrt{T - t}$$ and $$\phi(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}$$. Assume $$\vert g(y) \vert \leq C \vert y\vert^p$$ for some $$p, C > 0$$. That is, we want the contingent claim to have a polynomial growth. 

We have $$(x, t) \in (0, \infty) \times [0, T)$$, and letting $$y = x\exp(\alpha z - \alpha^2/2)$$ we get

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 x^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 0
$$
