        Hello! I'm Sudhansh, a first-year Masters in Computer Science student at <a href="https://ucsd.edu">UC San Diego</a>. I am a graduate of <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a>, where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering with honors and pursued a minor in Entrepreneurship.
  
        <br><br>
        I have worked with <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/">Prof. Ajit Rajwade</a> on the Likelihood Maximization method for Saturation Compressed Sensing. We are also working on developing algorithms for correction of Permutation Noise in Compressed Sensing. 
        We have submitted a journal paper to Elsevier Signal Processing 2023 based on this work. 
        In addition to this, I have worked with <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/M.Betcke.html">Prof. Marta Betcke</a> on Stochastic Primal Dual algorithms for Tomographic Reconstruction of 3D volumes in Low-Dose conditions, and we have a journal paper in preparation.
