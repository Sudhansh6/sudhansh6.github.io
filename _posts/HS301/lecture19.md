We will study Rene Descartes now.

## Rene Descartes (1596 - 1650)

He was a mathematician, and also made great contributions to philosophy using Mathematics as a method. During this time, the philosophers came back to the original metaphysical question, "What constitutes reality?". They also gave importance to the epistemological question, "What is the ultimate knowledge?". The modern philosophers, having made great advances in science, sought to find a scientific explanation for the above questions.

 Rene Descartes primarily focused on Epistemology. Descartes was a rationalist philosopher, and therefore he could not ignore metaphysics. He believed that the knowledge about the world is connected to knowledge about the self. Descartes also tried to establish the foundation for theological arguments.

## Descartes' Metaphysics / Classification of Sciences

Metaphysics contains the principle of knowledge concerning the principal attributes of God, the immateriality of soul, and all the clear and simple ideas that we possess. Physics, on the other hand, is the principle of material things, we examine in general, how the universe is framed/ particular nature of earth, and all the bodies commonly found.

Philosophy as a whole is like a tree whose roots are metaphysics, trunk is physics, and branches are all the other sciences. These main sciences can be reduced to medicine, mechanics, and morals. 

## Method and Criterion of Knowledge

Knowledge cannot be built on history but also requires the intervention of method. His method is famously known as **Descartes' Methodological Skepticism**. Philosophy discovers the truth in terms of mathematics.

## Methodological Skepticism

Descartes used both deduction and induction. He believed both the methods are equally important to reach conclusions. Senses are sometimes deceiving. Sometimes, the mathematical demonstrations can also be doubted. Memory can be deceptive and so its presentations.

## Doubt implies a Doubter

What kind of activity is doubting? 

> Thinking - res cogitans - The mind is a thinking thing
>
> I think = Cogito - Most self-evident proposition

I doubt, therefore, I think, therefore, I am,

> Dubito ergo cogito ergo sum
