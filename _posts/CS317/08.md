# ~ Chapter 5: Advanced SQL

Programming languages with automatic garbage collection cannot clean the data in databases. That is, if you try using large databases, then your system may hang.

## JDBC code

`DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@db_name")` is used to connect to the database. We need to close the connection after the work since each connection is a process on the server, and the server can have limited number of processes. In Java we check the `null` value using `wasNull()` function (not intuitive).

Prepared statements are used to take inputs from the user without SQL injection. We can also extract metadata using JDBC.

## SQL injection

The method where hackers insert SQL commands into the database using SQL queries. This problem is prevented by using `prepared statement`s.
